Repository for the code and manuscript associated with:

Park, Y., Maffre, P., Godd√©ris, Y., Macdonald, F. A., Anttila, E. S. C., and Swanson-Hysell, N. L., in preparation, Emergence of the Southeast Asian islands as a driver for Neogene cooling.

All analyses associated with this study are distributed amongst several Jupyter notebooks in `Code/Notebooks/`. However, the most important code associated with analyzing the GEOCLIM output can be found in `Code/Notebooks/parameter_exploration.ipynb` and `Code/Notebooks/scenario_analysis.ipynb`.

**Note:** Raw output from GEOCLIM (the silicate weathering model used in this study), which includes the calculated chemical weathering and regolith thickness for all exposed land on Earth, is not included in this repository due to the large size of these files. Please contact Yuem Park (yuempark@berkeley.edu) if you would like access to these raw output files.

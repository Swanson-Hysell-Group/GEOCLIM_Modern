    \label{fig:world_lithology}
\end{figure}

We restricted the calculation of the weathering fluxes to the flux of dissolved Ca+Mg originating from continental silicate weathering, as they are essential for the long-term consumption of atmospheric \COtwo through silicate weathering. To calculate this flux, we need to assign the concentration of Ca and Mg ($\chi_{CaMg}$) within the unweathered bedrock (Fig. 1 in the main text). Previous implementations of GEOCLIM have used a ``diffuse lithology'' where all exposed land is assigned the composition of bulk upper continental crust. These previous studies assumed that the weathering rates of all rocks was the same for each continental grid element, provided that the grid element was submitted to the same climatic conditions. Given that the hypothesis we seek to test involves the varying concentration of cations in different lithologies, we instead implement a more realistic lithologically-resolved version of the model.

The spatial distribution of lithologies is sourced from the Global Lithologic Map (GLiM) of \citet{Hartmann2012a}. The raw data takes the form of polygon vectors, where each polygon is assigned one of 16 lithologic categories. We first group these 16 categories into 6 broader categories (metamorphic, felsic, intermediate, mafic, carbonate, and siliciclastic sediment; Table \ref{tab:GLiM_to_GEOCLIM}). Note that the siliciclastic sediment lithologic category also includes sedimentary sequences in which any carbonate is identified but is not the dominant lithology \cite{Hartmann2012a}. We then rasterize the polygon vectors to 0.1\degrees $\times$ 0.1\degrees resolution, where each pixel is assigned the lithologic category of the polygon that covers the greatest area in that pixel (i.e. the `mode lithology'; Fig. \ref{fig:world_lithology}). To improve the computing time of GEOCLIM, we decrease the resolution of the raster to 0.5\degrees $\times$ 0.5\degrees. To do so, a 3-dimensional 720 $\times$ 360 $\times$ 7 matrix is created, in which the fraction of each 0.5\degrees $\times$ 0.5\degrees pixel covered by each of the 6 lithologic categories (or water/ice) is captured by the extra dimension. In this way, we calculate an area-weighted mean Ca+Mg concentration of the surface in each 0.5\degrees $\times$ 0.5\degrees pixel.

The Ca+Mg concentrations of felsic (1,521~mol/m$^{3}$), intermediate (4,759~mol/m$^{3}$), and mafic (10,317~mol/m$^{3}$) lithologies are assigned based on the mean of data compiled from EarthChem (\url{www.earthchem.org/portal}; calculations made in the code within the repository). For metamorphic and siliciclastic lithologies, we explore a range of feasible Ca+Mg concentrations during calibration of the silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM (\textit{GEOCLIM Calibration}). This approach makes the simplifying assumption that all pixels of a given lithologic category share the same Ca+Mg concentration.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Histograms showing the difference in the area-weighted mean Ca+Mg concentration of the surface in each 0.5\degrees $\times$ 0.5\degrees pixel that results from starting with an 0.1\degrees $\times$ 0.1\degrees GLiM raster versus an 0.05\degrees $\times$ 0.05\degrees GLiM raster. The left panel is calculated over all land pixels, whereas the right panel is calculated over land pixels in the SEAI only. Both panels use the parameter values that produced the highest $r^{2}$ during calibration: metamorphic$_{Ca+Mg}=2500$~mol/m$^{3}$ and sediment$_{Ca+Mg}=2000$~mol/m$^{3}$.}
    \label{fig:resolution_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

We also explore the sensitivity of the area-weighted mean Ca+Mg concentration of the surface in each 0.5\degrees $\times$ 0.5\degrees pixel to the resolution of the underlying GLiM raster (Fig. \ref{fig:resolution_sensitivity}). We find that the difference in the area-weighted mean Ca+Mg concentration of the surface when using the 0.1\degrees $\times$ 0.1\degrees GLiM raster versus the 0.05\degrees $\times$ 0.05\degrees GLiM raster can be well explained by a tight Gaussian distribution ($\sigma$\textless200~mol/m$^{3}$) about a mean of $\sim$0~mol/m$^{3}$. Therefore, using the lower-resolution GLiM raster does not overall bias our results to higher or lower area-weighted mean Ca+Mg concentrations of the surface, and only introduces some noise that has a magnitude that is significantly smaller than the most Ca+Mg-poor lithologic category (i.e. felsics, at 1,521~mol/m$^{3}$).

Experimental determinations of the activation energy ($E_a$; Equations 6 and 9) associated with the weathering of silicate minerals are variable \citep{Brantley2003a}. However, multiple efforts to invert for $E_a$ in basaltic watersheds with varying temperature have yielded values (41.6 $\pm$ 3.2~kJ/mol in \citealp{Li2016a}; 42.3~kJ/mol in \citealp{Dessert2001a}) that are consistent with the lower end of activation energies of Ca+Mg bearing minerals in laboratory experiments such as that for diopside (40.5 $\pm$ 1.7~kJ/mol; \citealp{Knauss1993a}) and for labradorite (42.1~kJ/mol; \citealp{Carroll2005a}). We use the value of 42~kJ/mol in our model runs. While we implement lithology-dependent Ca+Mg concentration, our implementation does not include lithology-dependent kinetics of mineral dissolution. Relative to felsic lithologies, mafic lithologies contain a higher concentration of minerals with faster dissolution kinetics (e.g. plagioclase). However, Ca+Mg from both felsic and mafic lithologies is predominantly sourced from minerals with faster dissolution kinetics, and we therefore use the same chemical weathering formulation (including the same activation energy) across lithologies.

Within the equation that governs the physical erosion rate in GEOCLIM (Equation 8), the values of the exponents ($m=0.5$ and $n=1$) are supported by compilations \citep{Lague2013a}. However, there is uncertainty in the value of the proportionality constant ($k_e$). Using the simplification of a uniform value, we therefore tune this value such that the total erosion flux in the model under present-day slope and runoff conditions (see below) matches the total erosion flux estimated in \citet{Milliman2013a} ($20\times10^{12}$~kg/yr). Assuming that the density of eroded materials is 2500~kg/m$^{3}$, our tuned $k_e$ value is 0.0029110~m$^{1-m}$/yr$^{1-m}$.

Within the equations that govern the chemical weathering rate in GEOCLIM, we identify the less constrained parameters: the proportionality constant that modifies the dependence of dissolution rate on runoff and temperature ($k_{d}$; Equation 9), the proportionality constant that modifies the dependence of dissolution rate on runoff only ($k_{w}$; Equation 9), the power constant that modifies the dependence of dissolution rate on the time that a rock particle has spent in the regolith ($\sigma$; Equation 4), and the proportionality constant that modifies the dependence of regolith production on runoff and temperature ($k_{rp}$; Equation 6). Furthermore, the Ca+Mg concentrations of metamorphic and siliciclastic sediment grid cells are difficult to define. We allow these parameters to vary within reasonable bounds during the calibration stage of GEOCLIM. In total, we test 93,600 unique parameter combinations (Fig. \ref{fig:r2_cross_plot}; Table \ref{tab:parameter_combinations}).

We compute spatially-resolved long-term \COtwo consumption (i.e. Ca+Mg fluxes) using present-day runoff (UNH/GRDC Composite Runoff Fields V1.0; \citealp{Fekete1999a}), temperature (CRU TS v.4.03; \citealp{Harris2013a}), and slope (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; \citealp{Farr2007a}) fields. As described in the main text, we sum the computed \COtwo consumption over large-scale watersheds that appear in the global compilation of \citet{Gaillardet1999a}, as well as smaller-scale watersheds of the Amazon Basin (HYBAM network) in the compilation of \citet{Moquet2011a}, \citet{Moquet2016a}, and \citet{Moquet2018a}. The latter are nested watersheds, which requires upstream weathering fluxes to be subtracted from downstream fluxes. Watersheds for which this subtraction yields an aberrant value are not considered. 80 watersheds in total are used in this study. We calculate the coefficient of determination ($r^{2}$) between computed and measured \COtwo consumption in each of these basins:

\begin{equation*}
    r^{2} = 1 - \frac{\sum\left[ \log_{10}(M_{i}) - \log_{10}(O_{i}) \right]^{2}}{\sum\left[ \log_{10}(O_{i}) - \overline{\log_{10}(O)} \right]^{2}}
    \label{eq:10}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
$M_{i}$ is the modeled \COtwo consumption over watershed $i$, $O_{i}$ is the observed \COtwo consumption over watershed $i$, and $\overline{\log_{10}(O)}$ is the mean of the log of observed \COtwo consumption over all watersheds.

The majority of the original 93,600 parameter combinations produce \COtwo consumption maps with poor fits to the measured watershed data (Fig. \ref{fig:W_vs_r2}). Given that the coefficient of determination ($r^{2}$) is calculated using Equation \ref{eq:10} rather than fitting a linear model, many of the combinations associated with particularly poor fits result in negative $r^{2}$ values (Fig. \ref{fig:W_vs_r2}). However, given the right permutation of parameters, GEOCLIM produces \COtwo consumption maps that fit the measured watershed data reasonably well. We eliminate all parameter combinations that produce a $r^{2}\leq0.5$, which leaves 573 unique parameter combinations (Figs. \ref{fig:W_vs_r2} and \ref{fig:r2_cross_plot}).

Global CO$_{2}$ consumption calculated from these 573 parameter combinations ranges from 3.7$\times10^{12}$~mol/yr to 6.3$\times10^{12}$~mol/yr, with a mean of 5.2$\times10^{12}$~mol/yr. These estimates fall within the range of independently estimated outgassing rates for the present-day: the full range of estimates of the present-day non-anthropogenic global CO$_{2}$ emission rate compiled in \citet{Gerlach2011a} is 3.0--10.0$\times10^{12}$~mol/yr, with the preferred range of those estimates being 3.4--5.9$\times10^{12}$~mol/yr (Fig. \ref{fig:W_vs_r2}B).

Each parameter combination predicts a different total \COtwo consumption that should match the \COtwo degassing at steady-state. Hence, in the non-calibration GEOCLIM experiments, each parameter combination is used with its corresponding steady-state \COtwo degassing. In these estimates, we are not including the effects of reverse weathering \citep{Michalopoulos1995a} as it is not clear how it should be parameterized and it is interpreted to be a relatively minor flux in the Cenozoic \citep{Isson2018a}. Formation of authigenic clays that scales with Ca and Mg concentration of riverine waters could decrease the \COtwo consumption associated with silicate weathering although the overall trend seen in this study would remain.

\end{figure}

A related issue is that our analysis focuses on the weathering of Ca and Mg silicates. Sources of alkalinity to the ocean include the four major cations of Ca, Mg, Na and K. A common approach for the long-term carbon cycle follows that of \citet{Berner1983a} where an emphasis is placed on Ca and Mg with the weathering of Na and K silicates considered to not be a long-term sink of \COtwo. The reasoning behind this assumption is that while weathering of these silicates can lead to transient uptake of \COtwo, this uptake is balanced by release. The ultimate mechanism through which silicate weathering sequesters carbon is the incorporation of Ca+Mg carbonates into the lithosphere. Given that Na and K are not precipitating carbonate, when simulating long term steady-state solutions, as we are here, it is valid to follow the approach of \citet{Berner1983a} and not consider the Na and K cycles. Complexity arises given the long residence time of Na and K in seawater ($\sim$45--80~m.y. for Na, and $\sim$8--10~m.y. for K; \citealp{Emerson2008a, Lecuyer2016a}) and the lag between the generation of alkalinity and its consumption that could modulate the carbonate system. Dynamic modeling of the effects of the Na and K cycles on the long term carbon cycle is an area ripe for future research although uncertainty in their sinks and the timescale of the processes that control them make them difficult to parameterize. An alternative approach for estimating carbon sequestration associated with silicate weathering that sought to incorporate all four cations was taken by \citet{France-Lanord1997a} who used a formulation of $\Delta \textrm{CO}_2 = \Delta \textrm{Mg} + \Delta \textrm{Ca} + 0.15 \Delta \textrm{Na} + 0.1 \Delta \textrm{K}$. This relationship, also applied by \citet{Schopka2011a}, assumes that all Ca$^{2+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ eventually forms carbonates and applies an estimate that 20\% of K$^{+}$ and 30\% of Na$^{+}$ exchanges for Ca and Mg and ultimately produces carbonate (and considers charge balance). Different parameterizations such as that of \citet{France-Lanord1997a} could modulate our estimates, but the importance of the emergence of the SEAI on Neogene \pCOtwo would remain unchanged. The relative importance of mafic lithologies also remains given that with significantly higher Ca+Mg concentrations and subequal Na+K concentrations to intermediate/felsic lithologies they have the highest Ca+Mg+Na+K concentrations (Fig. \ref{fig:lithology_composition}).

\section*{Climate Model}

For the climate model component of GEOCLIM, we use temperature and runoff fields from a subset of the GFDL CM2.0 experiments (\citealp{Delworth2006a, Delworth2006b}; available for download at \url{https://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/dods-data/gfdl_cm2_0/}) These experiments were performed in order to explore the effect of various changes in forcing agents on climate since ca. 1860 at 2.0\degrees $\times$ 2.5\degrees resolution. In the ``1860 control'' experiment, forcing agents representative of conditions ca. 1860 (including \COtwo, CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O, O$_{3}$, sulfates, carbon, dust, sea salt, solar irradiance, and the distribution of land cover types) are held constant for 500 years after reaching equilibrium. \pCOtwo in 1860 is assumed to be 286~ppm. In the ``+1\%/yr to 2$\times$'' experiment, initial conditions are taken from the ``1860 control'' experiment, then \pCOtwo is prescribed to increase from 286~ppm at a compounded rate of +1\% per year for 70 years, when \pCOtwo reaches double (572~ppm) of the initial value. \pCOtwo is then held constant until the end of the 280 year experiment. All non-\COtwo forcing agents are held constant. The ``+1\%/yr to 4$\times$'' experiment is identical to the ``+1\%/yr to 2$\times$'' experiment, except that \pCOtwo is prescribed to increase for 140 years, when \pCOtwo reaches quadruple (1144~ppm) of the initial value. \pCOtwo is then held constant for 160 years. We take the mean of the last 100 years of each of these three experiments (when \pCOtwo is being held constant at its final level) to obtain temperature and runoff fields for 286, 572, and 1144~ppm \pCOtwo respectively. Temperature and runoff fields associated with \pCOtwo values between the three modeled \pCOtwo levels (286, 572, and 1144~ppm) are obtained through linear interpolation between the model results.

Given that precipitation in the SEAI is primarily driven by large-scale convective upwelling leading to high precipitation over both land and water \citep{Donohoe2017a}, the current approach of using a climate model forced by modern paleogeography for all SEAI scenarios is a reasonable approximation for this region. However, for paleogeographic change that would have very significantly modified precipitation over broad swathes of land such as growth of the Himalaya, this approach of using modern climate model results is not viable. The climate model also assumes the present-day extent of ice-sheets for all \pCOtwo levels. However, without ice-sheets, the global climate would be warmer for a given \pCOtwo (hysteresis loop; \citealp{Pollard2005b}), but the amount of emergent land would be lower. We expect this bias to be minimal, as all of our modeled \pCOtwo estimates fall below the glaciation threshold for Antarctica.

    \caption{Paleogeographically-reconstructed paleoshorelines for SEAI at 5, 10, and 15~Ma, using the paleoshoreline reconstruction of this study coupled to the paleogeographic model of \citet{Matthews2016a}.}
    \label{fig:paleogeographic_reconstructions}
\end{figure}

We use geological data to quantify the changes in the area of SEAI over the past 15~m.y. (described in detail in \textit{Paleoshoreline Reconstruction and Geological Synthesis}). To generate the lithologic map used in the ``removed SEAI'' scenario (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAI_fracs}), we remove all land associated with arc-continent collision in SEAI. To generate the lithologic map used in the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAI_fracs}), we take the estimated paleoshorelines of SEAI for 15, 10, and 5~Ma, then remove all land that falls outside of these bounds. The slope and lithologic classification of each pixel is identical to that of the present day, provided that these pixels fall within the estimated paleoshorelines of SEAI for their respective time slice. This means that while we are changing the amount of emergent land, we are not changing the latitudinal or longitudinal position and are keeping the slope of emerged pixels the same. Given that similar distributions of lithology and slope are reasonable in the past and that latitudinal translation has been relatively minor, we consider this simplification to be reasonable to first-order (Fig. \ref{fig:paleogeographic_reconstructions}). We then add land in the region that is not exposed today. The assignment of lithology, runoff, and slope for pixels on the Sunda Shelf is not trivial, given that the shelf is not currently exposed. As discussed in \textit{Paleoshoreline Reconstruction and Geological Synthesis}, the Sunda Shelf is a flat-lying, relatively stable platform of continental crust. Islands between Malaysia/Sumatra and Borneo are composed of granite and are surrounded by shallow marine siliciclastic sediments \citep{Darmadi2007a, Hall2009a, Hall2013b}. However, basement highs of granite do not appear further to the northwest in the Gulf of Thailand, and seismic and drill core data suggest siliciclastic fluvial systems draining out toward the South China Sea when the Sunda Shelf was exposed \citep{Darmadi2007a}. We therefore assign pixels of the Sunda Shelf between Malaysia/Sumatra and Borneo to be 50\% felsic and 50\% sediment, and pixels further to the north to be 100\% sediment. For the slope, we take the mean slope value (0.0043~m/m) of relatively flat land on eastern Sumatra, and assign this value to all pixels of the Sunda Shelf. For the runoff, we linearly interpolate along latitude bands between present-day land pixels to obtain runoff values for the presently-submerged Sunda Shelf. This approach preserves large N-S variation in runoff associated with the large-scale Hadley circulation and therefore should be reasonable to first-order, although it does not accurately capture the smaller-scale interactions between land and ocean/atmosphere circulation. For other minor islands in the region that were exposed 15, 10, or 5~m.y. ago, but are currently submerged, we take the same approach as that described for the Sunda Shelf to generate the runoff field. For the slope and lithology, we take the mean slope and Ca+Mg concentrations from neighbouring pixels. We also remove the Greenland ice sheet in the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios, to be consistent with Northern Hemisphere ice sheets developing after 5~Ma \citep{Haug2005a}. The runoff field over Greenland is generated using the same method as that for the Sunda Shelf. For the slope, we take the mean slope value (0.0529~m/m) of land for which slope data exists around the edges of Greenland, and assign this value to all pixels of Greenland covered by the ice sheet. We also assign the Ca+Mg concentration of bulk continental crust to these pixels.

To explore the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of the Sunda Shelf and the removal of the Greenland ice sheet, we also tested ``paleo-SEAI - Greenland'' scenarios for 15, 10, and 5~Ma, which are identical to that of the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios without the removal of the Greenland ice sheet. We also tested ``paleo-SEAI - Greenland - Sunda Shelf'' scenarios for 15, 10, and 5~Ma, which are identical to that of the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios without the inclusion of the Sunda Shelf and the removal of the Greenland ice sheet. We find that the estimated steady state \pCOtwo's for the ``paleo-SEAI - Greenland'' and ``paleo-SEAI - Greenland - Sunda Shelf'' scenarios are only marginally higher than those of the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2_all}), suggesting that our results are relatively insensitive to the inclusion of the Sunda Shelf and the removal of the Greenland ice sheet. This insensitivity can be attributed to the low Ca+Mg concentrations of felsic and sediment lithologies in conjunction with the low relief across the Sunda Shelf, and the low runoff values at high latitudes.

Proxy-based \pCOtwo estimates for the past 20~m.y. are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pCO2_proxies} \citep{Bereiter2015a, Foster2017a, Ji2018a, Cui2020a}. Even when stringent quality criteria and the latest understanding of each of the \pCOtwo proxies have been applied to available \pCOtwo records, both significant uncertainty in the estimated \pCOtwo for any given data point as well as disagreement between techniques remain. Statistical methods that are often utilized in an attempt to extract trends from this data (e.g. locally-weighted scatter plot smoothing, LOWESS) evaluate the mean (with some weighting) of the highly scattered data in a given time interval. However, such methods are only appropriate for estimating the ``true'' value at any given time interval in datasets in which individual data points are being drawn from a single distribution about a mean value. The \pCOtwo proxy compilation shown in Figure \ref{fig:pCO2_proxies} consists of several distinct techniques and samples, each with their own set of assumptions and associated probability distributions that influence their reported values. Therefore, running a regression through these values neglects the fact that some of these techniques/samples are likely more reliable than the others. Constraining how robust each \pCOtwo proxy technique is remains an important challenge, and as such the ``true'' \pCOtwo could plausibly lie anywhere within the full range of proxy-based \pCOtwo estimates for any given time interval. Nevertheless, our modeled \pCOtwo values for 15~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2_all}) resemble the higher end of proxy-based \pCOtwo estimates for the early-mid-Miocene. Given this scatter in the proxy-based \pCOtwo estimates, we instead infer the Neogene cooling trend from the Miocene benthic foram oxygen isotope record shown in Figure 1 in the main text.

\section*{Paleoshoreline Reconstruction and Geological Synthesis}

Geological maps, stratigraphic data, and previous paleoshoreline compilations were used to calculate the changes in different types of subaerially exposed rocks in SEAI. Following \citet{Molnar2015a}, we analyzed the area changes of islands that are larger than $\sim$200~km$^{2}$ (Fig. 1 in main text). We also included changes in areas of submerged continental shelves that were previously exposed, like the Sunda Shelf. Larger islands were further divided into regions based upon their position on microplates as defined by \citet{Matthews2016a}. Miocene to present stratigraphic columns were compiled from each region to develop an age model for paleoenvironmental indicators. In general, carbonate strata and thin-bedded siliciclastic strata were assumed to be deposited in a subaqueous marine environment, whereas evidence for exposure and terrestrial siliciclastic deposits were used as indicators of a subaerial paleoenvironment. Following previous paleoshoreline compilations and these environmental indicators, paleoshorelines were outlined in QGIS to calculate areas for the Early Pliocene (5 Ma), Late Miocene (10 Ma), and Middle Miocene (15 Ma). The paleoshoreline reconstructions within the paleogeographic models broadly coincide with sub-Epoch boundaries (i.e. Early Miocene = 23--16~Ma, Middle Miocene = 15.99--11.61~Ma, Late Miocene = 11.6--5.4~Ma, Pliocene =5.39--3.8 Ma), but we recognize that the biostratigraphic resolution is an additional source of uncertainty.

Several new sources for paleoshoreline data have become available since \citet{Molnar2015a}. Particularly, for Sulawesi, we follow the recent stratigraphic compilation and paleoshorelines delineated by \citet{Nugraha2018a}, and in New Guinea, we follow \citet{Gold2017a} and \citet{Harrington2017a}. Although the outlines of our paleoshorelines are significantly different from those used for 5~Ma by \citet{Molnar2015a} our calculated area is comparable.

\subsection*{Malay Peninsula and Sunda Shelf}

Paleogeographic reconstructions of Peninsular Malaysia suggest that it has been largely exposed over the last 20~Ma \citep{Hall2002a, Hall2013b}. Although the majority of the Sunda Shelf is currently submerged, large portions of this flat-lying, relatively stable platform of continental crust were also emergent throughout the Neogene, and were repeatedly subaerially exposed during the Pleistocene as recently as the Last Glacial Maximum \citep{Hall2002a}. Similarities between the terrestrial biotas of Borneo and mainland Southeast Asia confirm the existence of land bridges on the Sunda Shelf throughout the Miocene \citep{Moss1998a}. Eocene through Miocene rifting of the South China Sea resulted in subsidence throughout the Sunda Shelf \citep{Morley2013a}. Grabens associated with this subsidence became freshwater rift lakes that later transitioned to partially enclosed inland seas and extensive brackish or saline wetland environments. Palynological analysis suggests widespread swamp environments persisting through the Late Miocene \citep{Morley2013a}. Basement highs (e.g. the Natuna Arch, currently subaerially exposed as the largely granitic island of Natuna off SW Borneo, as well as the granitic Tin Islands south of the Malay Peninsula) are typically bounded by Paleogene to Neogene basins dominated by shallow marine clastic fill \citep{Darmadi2007a}. Most paleogeographic reconstructions of the region incorporate some degree of exposure of the Sunda Shelf from 20~Ma onwards \citep{Hall2013b, Madon2013a}, although it is omitted in the 5~Ma paleogeographic model of \citet{Molnar2015a}.

\subsection*{Borneo and Palawan}

Our reconstructions of the paleoshorelines of Borneo and Palawan are largely informed by extant paleogeographic constructions detailed in \citet{Hall2001a, Hall2013a, Hall2013b}, as well as geologic maps and local shoreline reconstructions found in \citet{vandeWeerd1992a, Witts2012a, Madon2013a, Kessler2015a}. Comprised of Paleozoic to Mesozoic crustal components that were largely accreted to Sundaland by the late Cretaceous \citep{Metcalfe2013a}, the southern and western portions of Borneo (SW Kalimantan) have been subaerially exposed throughout the Neogene \citep{Hall2013a, Hall2013b}. A collision along the northern margin of Borneo associated with the initiation of rifting in the South China Sea resulted in the late Eocene uplift of the Central Range mountains \citep{Hutchison1996a}, which provide sediment to basins along the Southern (Kalimantan) and northern (Sabah and Sarawak) coasts of the island. In the east, the Barito, Kutei, and Tarakan basins developed as a single area of subsidence (associated with the opening of the Makassar Straits in the Eocene) before the basins were isolated by Oligocene faulting and Miocene uplift \citep{Witts2012a}. The Kutei Basin is characterized by eastward-prograding deltaic and shallow shelf deposits that have been steadily supplied with sediment from the Schwaner Mountains of SW Kalimantan and the Central Range \citep{vandeWeerd1992a}. North of the Kutei Basin, the deltaic deposits found in the Tarakan Basin similarly prograde eastward from the mid Miocene onward, fed by the northern drainages of the Central Range \citep{Satyana1999a}. In SE Kalimantan, the Barito Basin is bounded to the east by the ophiolite-bearing Meratus Mountains. Sedimentological data suggests that the Meratus Mountains were not emergent until the Late Miocene \citep{Witts2012a}.

Separated from the Paleozoic continental core of SW Borneo by the Lupar Line suture zone, the northern portion of Borneo (Sabah) is underlain by ophiolitic basement that extends to Palawan \citep{Hall2008a, Ilao2018a}. The Sarawak Basin and NW Borneo trough offshore Sabah host $>$10~km-thick Neogene sedimentary sequences, indicative of the extent and duration of exhumation in northern Borneo \citep{Hall2008a}. The Late Oligocene/Early Miocene Sabah Orogeny resulted in the uplift of both Sabah and southern Palawan \citep{Hall2013a}, as well as the obduction of the Palawan ophiolite and Telupid ophiolite of northern Sabah. Under-thrusting of thinned passive-margin continental crust beneath these suprasubduction ophiolites resulted in Early to Middle Miocene exhumation and offshore unconformities \citep{Hall2008a}. Early Miocene sediments in northern Sabah have a provenance from Palawan \citep{Suggate2014a}, indicating that Palawan, like northern Borneo, experienced uplift during the Sabah orogeny. However, initiation of back-arc extension in the Sulu Sea around 19~Ma \citep{Hall2013a} resulted in the subsidence of the eastern Palawan Mountains, eliminating or reducing the role of Palawan as a sediment source for the Borneo trough. The 14~Ma Capoas Granite on Palawan and the 7.5~Ma Kinabalu Granite in Sabah are interpreted to be the result of crustal thinning related to pulses of regional backarc extension \citep{Hall2013a}. Thermochronological data from the Sabah highlands suggest extremely rapid uplift (7~km/m.y.) and exhumation during the latest Miocene and early Pliocene, resulting in the recent formation of Mt. Kinabalu, the tallest peak in Borneo \citep{Cottam2013a}.

\subsection*{Sulawesi}

For the paleoshorelines of Sulawesi, we largely followed the recent stratigraphic compilation and paleoshorelines compilation of \citet{Nugraha2018a}. Geographically, Sulawesi can be divided into a central highland region flanked by North, South, Southeast, and East Arms. These arms have high relief ($>$3~km) that are separated by deep basins and broadly define Sulawesi's seven tectonic provinces: 1) the West Sulawesi magmatic arc of the South Arm, 2) the Central Sulawesi metamorphic Belt, 3) the Sangihe arc of the North Arm, 4) the East Sulawesi Ophiolite of the East Arm, 5) the southeast metamorphic belt of the Southeast Arm, and the microcontinental blocks of 6) Banggai-Sula and 7) Buton-Tukang Besi \citep{Hamilton1979a, Katili1978a}. Like SW Borneo, the North and South Arms, and much of Central Sulawesi, are underlain by continental blocks that rifted off of the Australian-Birds Head margin in the Jurassic and collided in the Cretaceous with Eurasian basement of Sundaland as part of the Woyla Arc system \citep{Parkinson1998b, Hennig2016a, Hall2017a, Hennig2017a}. After collision, subduction polarity reversed and a Cretaceous to Miocene SE-facing volcanic arc developed \citep{Polve1997a, Elburg1998a} that was connected to the paleo-Sunda Arc \citep{Hall2002b}, also referred to as the Great Indonesian arc \citep{Harris2006a}.  The ophiolites of Sulawesi were generated in this arc system in a back-arc to intra-arc setting \citep{Monnier1995a} (but see \citealp{Kadarusman2004a} for an alternative view) and the largest fragments of the East Sulawesi ophiolite were detached from their metamorphic sole in the late Oligocene (32--28~Ma; \citealp{Parkinson1998a}) and thrust to the east above a west dipping slab (East Sulawesi block; \citealp{Villeneuve2001a}). During the Early to Middle Miocene, the Tukang Besi-Buton block began to collide obliquely with the southeastern end of the Sunda Arc, causing ophiolite emplacement in West and SE Sulawesi, including Buton \citep{Smith1991a, Bergman1996a}.

The North Arm consists of Late Pliocene and younger volcanic rocks built upon Eocene to Early Miocene oceanic basalt, basaltic andesite, pelagic sediments, and metamorphic rocks \citep{Elburg1998a}. Eocene to Early Miocene volcanic rocks formed above a NW dipping slab in an arc system that extended to West and South Sulawesi \citep{vanLeeuwen2005a}. Gorontalo Bay is an extensional basin that formed in the Pliocene, and prior to that time, the East Sulawesi was attached to the North Arm of Sulawesi. After the Oligocene to Early Miocene accretion of the East Sulawesi ophiolite, the arc system stepped out to the SE forming a Neogene (23--16~Ma) volcanic belt on the East arm \citep{Kadarusman2004a}. In the Late Miocene, SE-dipping subduction was initiated below the North Arm, which continues today at the North Sulawesi Trough. North Sulawesi was not substantially emergent until the Pliocene \citep{vanLeeuwen2005a}. Active volcanoes extend from the North Arm through the Sangihe Arc into the southern Philippines.

The East and Southeast Arms consist predominantly of mafic and ultramafic rocks of the East Sulawesi Ophoilite that are exposed for more than 10,000~km$^{2}$ \citep{Monnier1995a}. The East Arm preserves a complete ophiolitic sequence underlain by a metamorphic sole, m\'elange, imbricate continental margin and crystalline basement with a blueschist metamorphic overprint \citep{Silver1983a, Monnier1995a, Parkinson1998a}. Locally, the structural thickness of the ophiolite exceeds 15~km with surface relief over 3~km \citep{Kadarusman2004a}. Seventeen igneous K-Ar dates from the East Sulawesi ophiolite range from 93--32~Ma, clustering between 60~Ma and 40~Ma \citep{Parkinson1998b}. K-Ar dates on hornblende from the metamorphic sole yielded cooling ages between 36--23~Ma \citep{Parkinson1998a, Villeneuve2001a}, which dates the initial emplacement of the East Sulawesi ophiolite as the north Sulawesi volcanic arc was underthrusted by the Sula spur (Australian crust) \citep{Silver1983a, Parkinson1998a}; however, despite these relatively old ages of emplacement, it appears that the ophiolites on the East Arm were not substantially subaerially exposed and exhumed until the Miocene.

Collision of the Sula-Banggai block with the East margin of Sulawesi began in the latest Miocene and uplift accelerated in the early Pliocene (5.2~Ma to 3.8~Ma) and is associated with a major pulse of sedimentation in adjacent basins \citep{Davies1990a, Villeneuve2000a}. Off the northeast margin of the east arm of Sulawesi, Miocene platform carbonates on the Sula-Banggai block are overlain by Late Miocene to Early Pliocene ophiolite detritus in the Celebes m\'elange \citep{Davies1990a}. Thus, although the East Sulawesi ophiolite was trapped/emplaced onto the composite Sundaland margin (i.e. a fragment of previously accreted Australian crust) between 36~Ma and 23~Ma, mafic and ultramafic rocks on the south and west arms appear to have not been substantially subaerially exposed in the south and west arms until after 15~Ma, and on the east arm until after 5~Ma.

West Sulawesi rifted from Borneo during the Eocene forming the Makassar Straits back arc basin behind a southwest-facing arc \citep{Polve1997a}. Eroded fragments of ophiolite and extensive belts of volcanic rocks are preserved on the West and South Arms of Sulawesi \citep{Bergman1996a, vanLeeuwen2010a}. During the Middle Miocene (ca. 15--13~Ma), extensional faults in the Bone basin reversed, which was accompanied by uplift and erosion of the Bone Mountain ophiolite and Lamasi complex in West Sulawesi \citep{Bergman1996a, vanLeeuwen2010a}. Shortening was likely due to the collision of the leading edge of the Buton-Tukang Besi block, which collided with Buton and the SE Arm of Sulawesi \citep{Smith1991a}. Uplift and erosion is recorded by the presence of a major Middle Miocene unconformity and sedimentary breccias in marginal basins \citep{Bergman1996a, vanLeeuwen2010a}. Uplift was diachronous, not effecting units below and to the west of the Lamasai ophiolite until the Middle Miocene (ca. 13~Ma) \citep{vanLeeuwen2010a}. Alkali volcanism ensued at ca. 11~Ma and is associated with a second phase of extension and exhumation from the Late Miocene to Pliocene with fission track ages implying deep exhumation \citep{Smith1991a, Bergman1996a, vanLeeuwen2010a}.

Fission track ages from granitoids in central Sulawesi indicate rapid uplift of Central Sulawesi (200--700~m/m.y.) starting at about 5~Ma associated with movement on the Palo-Koro fault \citep{Bellier2006a}. The fault system also shows a normal component with rapid exhumation of rock west of the fault in western Sulawesi -- all fission track dates are younger than 5~Ma \citep{Bellier2006a}. Just east of the Palo-Koro fault, the Palu Metamorphic Complex was exhumed in the Late Miocene to early Pliocene in the north (ca. 5.3~Ma) and later Pliocene in the south (ca. 3.1--2.7~Ma) at rates of up to 400~m/m.y. \citep{Hennig2017b}.

\subsection*{New Guinea and Halmahera}

Paleoshoreline maps were georeferenced from several previous tectonic and paleogeographic analyses, most notably those of \citet{Nichols1991a, Cloos2005a, Gold2017a, Harrington2017a}. These studies were all based to varying degrees on lithological distributions, biostratigraphic, borehole data, and tectonic models. We complimented these data with our stratigraphic compilations for the region to provide further paleoenvironmental context.

Northern New Guinea, including the Melanesian Arc, was emplaced above the Australian plate during the Miocene \citep{Hamilton1979a, Cloos2005a, vanUfford2005a, Baldwin2012a}. Two major ophiolite belts marking the suture -- the Irian-Marum ophiolite belt (including the April ultramafics), and the Papuan Ultramafic Belt (PUB) -- are preserved along the Central Range and Peninsular Range, respectively. South of the Irian-Marum ophiolites, the Ruffaer Metamorphic Complex constructed from the accretionary wedge, forms the spine of the Central Range (up to $\sim$5~km elevation today).

The Middle Miocene (16--14~Ma) basal Makats Formation contains siliciclastic sediment that was transported from the south into the forearc basin associated with the Irian-Marum ophiolite belt \citep{Visser1962a, Cloos2005a}. The beginning of widespread synorogenic sedimentation to the south and on the Australian continental basement was later at ca. 12~Ma \citep{vanUfford2005a}. Mountain building began in Late Miocene time, ca. 8--7~Ma \citep{vanUfford2005a, Baldwin2012a}, but major relief was not generated until the Pliocene \citep{Weiland1996a}. Similarly, the Marum ophiolite was uplifted between 8--5~Ma with 3--4~km of denudation \citep{Crowhurst1996a}. An estimated 80--100~km of shortening has been accommodated by deformation on the south side of the Central Range \citep{Hill1989a, Cloos2005a}.

Along the Papuan Peninsula of Eastern New Guinea, the PUB was obducted above a north dipping slab during Oligocene arc-continent collision between Australian continental fragments and the Melanesian arc, but remained largely subaqueous until the Miocene \citep{Davies1971a, Davies1984a, vanUfford2005a}. Miocene to present arc-continent collision in New Guinea has progressed from west to east. Exhumation of the Central Range accelerated over the past 4~m.y. which is interpreted to be the result of slab-breakoff and buoyant uplift \citep{Cloos2005a}. A change to left-lateral lateral motion on the northern coast of New Guinea at this time, caused the exhumation of ophiolites both along the coast \citep{Monnier1999a} and on the islands Obi \citep{Ali2001a} and Halmahera \citep{Hall1988a, Ballantyne1992a}. In eastern New Guinea, progressive jamming of the north-dipping subduction zone has caused major uplift over the past 4~Ma \citep{vanUfford2005a}, which is well dated with a change in provenance from continental to volcanic detritus \citep{Abbott1994a} and thermochronology \citep{Hill1989a}.

In the Bird’s Neck of western New Guinea, the Lengguru fold belt formed during Middle to Late Miocene clockwise rotation and obduction of the Weyland Terrane \citep{Bailly2009a}. Recent counter-clockwise rotation has exhumed several core complexes and has produced Pliocene compressional deformation to the southwest in the Misool-Onin-Kumawa Ridge \citep{Sapin2009a}.

\subsection*{Philippines}

Our reconstructions of the paleoshorelines of the Phillipines were primarily informed by the paleogeographic reconstructions of \citet{Hall1997a}, coupled with geologic maps of the archipelago \citep{GeologicalSurveyDivision1963a}. The Philippine ophiolites have been grouped in four distinct belts \citep{Yumul2007a}. We combine belts 1 and 2 in an eastern suture zone and belts 3 and 4 in a western suture zone. Belts 1 and 2 were juxtaposed in the eastern suture zone during sinistral transpression, which resulted in Early Miocene uplift and deposition of coarse clastic sediments \citep{Pubellier1991a}. The Palawan microcontinental block and Philippine mobile belt collided during late Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene resulting into the emplacement of the western ophiolites, with exhumation extending from the Late Miocene to the present \citep{Yumul2013a}. In addition to collision, arc magmatism contributed significantly to crustal growth in the Philippines \citep{Dimalanta2006a}.

\subsection*{Sunda-Banda Arc}

Paleoshoreline reconstructions of the Sunda-Banda Arc system relied largely on the work of \citet{Hall2013a}. The Sunda-Banda Arc system is composed of thick sequences of mixed sedimentary rocks and basement intruded and overlain by igneous rocks derived from continual arc magmatism through much of the Cenozoic \citep{Hall2017a}. Sumatra is the largest island within the Sunda-Banda Arc system that stretches from the Andaman Sea in the northwest to the Banda Sea in the east. The western portion of the Sumatra is underlain by the Wolya ophiolite, which was obducted in the Cretaceous and exhumed in the Eocene to Oligocene \citep{Allen2008a}, whereas the southeast corner on the islands of Bangka and Belitung is composed of granite basement of the Sunda Shelf \citep{Hall2009a, Hall2013b}. Java is composed of a complex of E-W-striking deformational and magmatic belts \citep{AudleyCharles2004a}. The belts have a volcanic arc in the south and a continental shelf to the north with an adjacent sedimentary basin \citep{AudleyCharles2004a}. Bali and Flores are mostly volcanic with some sedimentary cover \citep{Hall2009a}.

Exhumation of the modern Sunda-Banda Arc is the result of ongoing arc-continent collision with the subducting Australian Plate \citep{Harris2006a}. From ca. 20--10~Ma, the majority of Sumatra and nearly all of Java were submerged, although Bangka and Belitung were exposed in addition to a portion of the greater Sunda Shelf \citep{Hall2009a, Hall2013b}. Six major islands were subaerially exposed before 5~Ma: Sumatra, Belitung, Bangka, Java, Bali, and Flores. However, most of Sumatra and Java were elevated above sea level and emerged to their present exposures only since 5~Ma \citep{Hall2009a, Hall2013b}. Most of the non-volcanic islands of the Outer Banda Arc emerged after 5~Ma, associated with slab roll-back and collision with the Australian continental margin \citep{AudleyCharles2004a, Harris2006a, Hall2013b}. In Timor and Sumba, arc-continent collision resulted in rapid uplift of deep marine sedimentary rocks to elevations $>$1~km above sea level with estimated average uplift rates of 1.5~km/m.y. \citep{AudleyCharles1986a}.

% \section*{Seawater Model}

% If the weathering of juvenile lithologies of the SEAI played an important role in driving Neogene cooling, the intuitive expectation is that marine \SrSr should have decreased over the Neogene as the global weathering flux of low \SrSr juvenile lithologies increased (compensated by a decrease in the global weathering flux of high \SrSr radiogenic lithologies to maintain constant global \COtwo consumption). Contrary to this expectation, marine \SrSr has been rising since ca. 35~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:seawater_model}). However, the global weathering flux of isotopically-representative lithologies can be decoupled from marine \SrSr via the regional weathering of isotopically-unique source rocks. For example, the decrease in slope in the marine \SrSr record ca. 15~Ma has been attributed to exhumation of relatively low \SrSr and high \OsOs Outer Lesser Himalaya lithologies \citep{Myrow2015a, Colleps2018a}. This change in slope could also be at least partially driven by the exhumation of mafic and organic-rich forearc sediments in the SEAI during arc-continent collision.

% To test whether the Neogene marine \SrSr record is compatible with an increase in the global weathering flux of low \SrSr juvenile lithologies over the Neogene, we implement a simple seawater model that simulates changes in marine \SrSr that result from changing fluxes from several sources \citep{Brass1975a}:

% \begin{equation*}
%     \frac{dR_{SW}}{dt} = \frac{1}{\tau} \sum_{i} \frac{F_{i}}{F_{tot}}(R_{i} - R_{SW})
% \end{equation*}

% $R_{SW}$ is the \SrSr composition of the ocean, $t$ is time in the model, $\tau$ is the residence time of strontium in the oceans, $F_{i}$ is the flux of strontium from source $i$, $F_{tot}$ is the total flux of strontium from all sources, and $R_{i}$ is the \SrSr composition of source $i$. We define 6 simplified sources of strontium to the oceans (Table \ref{tab:seawater_model}): the non-Himalayan subaerial weathering of radiogenic (older cratonic rocks such as gneiss and granite), juvenile (such as basalt), and carbonate lithologies, the Himalayan subaerial weathering of radiogenic and carbonate lithologies, and the weathering of ocean crust during hydrothermal circulation on or near mid-ocean ridges.

% At initialization, we set the Sr flux from each of these sources such that at 50~Ma marine \SrSr is $\sim$0.7078 (Fig. \ref{fig:seawater_model}). As a percentage of the total Sr input into the ocean, this model yields hydrothermal = 10\%, carbonate = 35\%, radiogenic lithologies = 13\%, and juvenile lithologies = 42\%. These ini- tial steady-state Sr fluxes are similar to those estimated for the present-day (hydrothermal = 10\%, carbonate = 35\%, radiogenic lithologies = 25\%, and juvenile lithologies = 30\%, from \citealt{Allegre2010a}). The residence time of strontium in the oceans is poorly constrained, primarily due to the lack of constraints on the input flux of strontium from hydrothermal systems. Recent estimates for this residence time range from $\sim$1.7--3.7~m.y. \citep{Krabbenhoft2010a}, so we use a value that falls within this range (2.4~m.y.; \citealp{Ravizza2003a}).

% The \SrSr of Himalayan lithologies is highly variable, with values ranging from $\sim$0.71--1.11 \citep{Oliver2003a}, and as orogenesis proceeded, the \SrSr of waters draining the Himalayas has changed as different tectonic units are exhumed, as evidenced by the \SrSr of pedogenic clays in the Bengal Fan and soil carbonate in Nepal, which are interpreted to reflect the \SrSr of Himalayan rivers (Fig. \ref{fig:seawater_model}; \citealp{Derry1996a, Quade1997a}). In our model, we make the assumption that the \SrSr of waters draining the Himalayas has been constant at 0.720 prior to 16~Ma, when the Outer Lesser Himalaya began to be exhumed \citep{Myrow2015a, Colleps2018a}. We also assume that the ratio of Sr coming from carbonates vs. radiogenic lithologies has remained constant throughout the past 50 m.y. (i.e. 70\% from carbonates and 30\% from radiogenic lithologies; \citealp{Oliver2003a}). Finally, we assume that the average \SrSr composition of Himalayan carbonates and radiogenic lithologies that are being weathered at any given time is identical. Although this final assumption is likely incorrect in detail, it has been shown that Sr in carbonates from the Lesser and Higher Himalaya have equilibrated with Sr in coexisting silicates \citep{Oliver2003a}, which at least partially justifies our simplifying assumption.

% We maintain initial conditions until 35~Ma, at which point we begin to change both global and Himalayan subaerial weathering fluxes (Fig. \ref{fig:seawater_model}). The two primary watersheds draining the Himalayas are the Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra basins. Together, the Sr flux from these two watersheds in the present day is $\sim$9.5$\times$10$^{8}$~mol/yr. We therefore linearly increase the total Sr flux coming from the Himalayas to 1$\times$10$^{9}$~mol/yr from 35~Ma to present. We also linearly increase the Sr flux coming from non-Himalayan radiogenic lithologies 35--16~Ma. Importantly, we also linearly decrease the Sr flux coming from non-Himalayan juvenile lithologies over this same time period in order to maintain constant \COtwo consumption (i.e. constant global Ca+Mg flux from subaerial silicate weathering). In order to match the observed increase in marine \SrSr ca. 35--16~Ma, the Sr flux coming from non-Himalayan juvenile lithologies needs to be increased to a value 1.42$\times$ the initial value.

% At 16~Ma, we begin to change the subaerial weathering fluxes in accordance with existing constraints (Fig. \ref{fig:seawater_model}). First, the total Sr flux from Himalayan lithologies continues to linearly increase. Second, we linearly decrease the \SrSr of Himalayan lithologies from 0.720 to 0.715 16--12~Ma, then linearly increase it from 0.715 to 0.740 12--3~Ma, then linearly decrease it from 0.740 to 0.728 3--0~Ma. The first \SrSr decrease is intended to represent the exhumation of low \SrSr Outer Lesser Himalaya lithologies, the second \SrSr increase is intended to represent the exhumation of higher \SrSr Inner Lesser Himalaya lithologies \citep{Myrow2015a, Colleps2018a}, and the third \SrSr decrease is intended to represent a Pliocene-Quaternary fall in Himalayan riverine \SrSr to present-day values. These Himalayan \SrSr changes are consistent with the scattered \SrSr of pedogenic clays in the Bengal Fan and soil carbonate in Nepal \citep{Derry1996a, Quade1997a}.

% In addition to these Himalayan changes, we also linearly decrease the Ca+Mg flux coming from non-Himalayan radiogenic lithologies to a value 0.96$\times$ the 16~Ma value. This 0.96 value was obtained from our GEOCLIM simulations, in which the Ca+Mg flux coming from radiogenic lithologies using modern paleogeographic boundary conditions was $\sim$0.96$\times$ the Ca+Mg flux coming from radiogenic lithologies using 15~Ma paleogeographic boundary conditions.

% By imposing the geologically reasonable parameters described above, we are able to broadly reproduce the marine \SrSr record (``scenario 1'' in Figure \ref{fig:seawater_model}). In particular, despite an increasing contribution of low \SrSr strontium from juvenile lithologies over the past 16~m.y., marine \SrSr continues to rise due to the weathering of highly radiogenic lithologies in the Himalayas. To illustrate the effect of the weathering of these high \SrSr Himalayan lithologies, we also run an experiment in which we keep the \SrSr of Himalayan lithologies constant throughout the entire simulation (``scenario 2'' in Figure \ref{fig:seawater_model}). Without the contribution from the Himalayas, marine \SrSr begins to decrease after 16~Ma.

% While our model is forced by a simplistic representation of Sr fluxes to the ocean, it nevertheless demonstrates the notion that the marine \SrSr can be decoupled from globally-averaged weathering fluxes of isotopically-representative lithologies via the regional weathering of isotopically-unique source rocks. Therefore, an increase in the global weathering flux of low \SrSr juvenile lithologies over the Neogene is plausibly compatible with rising marine \SrSr over the same time period.

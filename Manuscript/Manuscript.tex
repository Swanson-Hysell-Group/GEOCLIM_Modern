\significancestatement{The Southeast Asian islands are a modern-day hotspot of \COtwo consumption via silicate weathering. Since $\sim$15 million years ago, these islands have been increasing in size at the same time that Earth's climate has been cooling. Here we test the hypothesis that this global cooling could have been driven by tectonic emergence of the Southeast Asian islands. Using a new compilation of paleoshorelines in conjunction with a coupled silicate weathering and climate model, we find that this emergence is associated with a large decrease in \pCOtwo. Without these changes in tropical island paleogeography, there would not have been large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets as a defining feature of Earth's climate over the past 3 million years.}

\begin{abstract}
Steep topography, a tropical climate, and mafic lithologies contribute to efficient chemical weathering and carbon sequestration in the Southeast Asian islands. Ongoing arc-continent collision between the Sunda-Banda arc system and Australia has increased the area of subaerially exposed land in the region since the mid-Miocene. Concurrently, Earth's climate has cooled since the Miocene Climatic Optimum, leading to growth of the Antarctic ice sheet and onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. We seek to evaluate the hypothesis that the emergence of the Southeast Asian islands played a significant role in driving this cooling trend through increasing global weatherability. To do so, we have compiled paleoshoreline data and incorporated them into GEOCLIM, which couples a global climate model to a silicate weathering model with spatially resolved lithology. We find that without the increase in area of the Southeast Asian islands over the Neogene, atmospheric \pCOtwo would have been significantly higher than pre-industrial values, remaining above the levels necessary for initiating Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.

\dropcap{T}he Southeast Asian islands (SEAI) have an out-sized contribution to modern chemical weathering fluxes relative to its area. The confluence of steep topography, a warm and wet tropical climate, and the presence of mafic lithologies results in high fluxes of Ca and Mg cations in the dissolved load and associated \COtwo consumption \cite{Gaillardet1999a, Hartmann2009a, Milliman2013a, Hartmann2014a}. There has been a significant increase in the area of subaerially exposed land within the region since the mid-Miocene associated with ongoing arc-continent collision between Australia and the Sunda-Banda arc system \cite{Molnar2015a, Hall2017a, Macdonald2019a}. Concurrently, after the Miocene Climatic Optimum, a cooling trend began ca. 15~Ma and accelerated over the past 4 million years (m.y.) leading to the development of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets \cite{Shackleton1984a, Zachos2001a}. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this cooling trend including changes in ocean/atmosphere circulation \cite{Haug1998a, Shevenell2004a, Molnar2015a}, a decrease in volcanic degassing \cite{Berner1983a}, or uplift in the Himalaya \cite{Raymo1988a, Galy2007a}. Here we seek to evaluate the hypothesis that emergence of the SEAI was a significant factor in driving long-term climatic cooling over the Neogene.

Over geologic time-scales, \COtwo enters Earth's ocean--atmosphere system primarily via volcanism and metamorphic degassing, and leaves primarily through the chemical weathering of silicate rocks and through organic carbon burial \cite{Kump2000a}. Chemical weathering delivers alkalinity and cations to the ocean which drives carbon sequestration through carbonate precipitation. Steady-state \pCOtwo is set at the \pCOtwo level at which \COtwo sinks are equal to sources. As \COtwo sinks increase and \pCOtwo falls, temperature decreases and the hydrological cycle is weakened, causing the efficiency of the silicate weathering sink to decrease until a new steady-state is achieved at lower \pCOtwo \cite{Kump1997a}.

Topography, climate, and lithology all effect chemical weathering. High-relief regions generally lack extensive regolith development, and thus tend to have reaction-limited weathering regimes that are more prone to adjust when climate changes \cite{Gabet2009a, West2012a, Maher2014a}. High physical erosion rates contribute to high chemical weathering fluxes in these high-relief regions \citep{Godderis2017b}. In warm and wet regions, mineral dissolution kinetics are faster leading to enhanced chemical weathering \cite{Lasaga1994a, West2012a}. Mafic rocks have higher Ca and Mg concentrations and dissolution rates than felsic rocks, and thus have the potential to more efficiently sequester carbon through silicate weathering \cite{Dessert2003a}. These factors have led to the proposal that arc-continent collisions, which create steep landscapes that include mafic lithologies, within the tropical rain belt have been important in enhancing global weatherability, lowering atmospheric \pCOtwo, and initiating glacial climate over the past 520~m.y. \cite{Jagoutz2016a, Swanson-Hysell2017a, Macdonald2019a} and perhaps in the Neoproterozoic as well \cite{Park2020a}.

Quantitatively estimating the magnitude of decrease in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with the emergence of a region with a high carbon sequestration potential, such as the SEAI, requires constraints on changing tectonic context and accounting of associated feedbacks. As this region emerges, the total global silicate weathering flux will transiently exceed the volcanic degassing flux, causing \pCOtwo to initially decline until a new steady-state is established where the total magnitude of the \COtwo sinks is the same as before the change. However, the sensitivity of the silicate weathering flux in any particular location to this change in \pCOtwo is variable and dependent on the specific topography, climate, and lithology at that location. Furthermore, how regional climate responds to this change in \pCOtwo is itself spatially variable. Therefore, the magnitude of \pCOtwo change that is required to balance the total global silicate weathering flux with the volcanic degassing flux will depend on the specific spatial distribution of topography, climate, and lithology at the time of emergence. As a result, any attempt to meaningfully estimate the decrease in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with emergence of the SEAI must model spatially resolved climatology and silicate weathering fluxes in tandem and account for the spatial distribution of the factors that affect these inter-connected systems.

\section*{GEOCLIM Model}

To estimate the decrease in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with the increase of subaerially exposed land area in the SEAI, we use the global spatially resolved GEOCLIM model \cite{Godderis2017c}. GEOCLIM estimates changes in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with coupled changes in erosion, chemical weathering, and climatology by linking a silicate weathering model to climate model runs at multiple \pCOtwo levels.

\subsection*{Silicate Weathering Component}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figures/regolith_schematic.pdf}
    \caption{A schematic representation of the silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM in a single profile at steady-state. A rock particle leaves the unweathered bedrock with production rate $P_{r}$, and transits vertically through a regolith of height $h$. Regolith production and physical erosion ($E_{p}$) are equal at steady-state. As a particle transits upwards, some fraction of the primary phases ($x$) are chemically weathered ($W$), with the flux of dissolved Ca+Mg being $W$ multiplied by the concentration of Ca+Mg in unweathered bedrock ($\chi_{CaMg}$). Details of the formulation for the silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM can be found in \MM.}
    \label{fig:regolith_schematic}
\end{figure}

The silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM calculates \COtwo consumption resulting from silicate weathering for subaerially exposed land. We assume that Ca and Mg are the only cations that consume \COtwo over geologic time-scales, such that each mole of Ca or Mg that is dissolved by silicate weathering consumes one mole of \COtwo. While reverse weathering is another potential sink for Ca or Mg \citep{Michalopoulos1995a}, its parameterization is unclear and it has been interpreted to be a relatively minor flux in the Cenozoic \citep{Isson2018a}, and we do not include it in our model. In previous versions of the model, silicate weathering was a function of temperature and runoff only, and all bedrock was assigned identical chemical compositions \cite{Godderis2017c}. More recent versions of GEOCLIM implement regolith development and soil shielding (Fig. \ref{fig:regolith_schematic}), which introduces a dependence on erosion rate (and therefore topographic slope) \cite{Maffre2018a}. While this introduction of regolith development into GEOCLIM is important for assessing the impact of tropical arc-continent collisions on \pCOtwo, the relatively high Ca+Mg concentration in arc rocks relative to other lithologies must also be considered.

We therefore implement variable bedrock Ca+Mg concentration into GEOCLIM (\SI). The spatial distribution of lithologies is sourced from the Global Lithologic Map (GLiM) \cite{Hartmann2012a} and is represented by 6 categories: metamorphic, felsic, intermediate, mafic, carbonate, and siliciclastic sediment. Each land pixel is assigned these lithologic categories at a resolution of 0.1\degrees $\times$ 0.1\degrees. The Ca+Mg concentrations of felsic, intermediate, and mafic lithologies are assigned based on the mean of data of these lithologic categories compiled in EarthChem (\url{www.earthchem.org/portal}). Given that GLiM does not distinguish ultramafic lithologies, such rocks are grouped with mafic rocks. As a result, the Ca+Mg concentration is likely an underestimate in regions of obducted ophiolites, such that the estimated effect of these regions on changing steady-state \pCOtwo could be conservative \cite{Schopka2011a}. The weathering of carbonate does not contribute to long-term \COtwo consumption and its Ca+Mg concentration is ignored. The Ca+Mg concentrations of metamorphic and siliciclastic sediment lithologies are more difficult to define, since their chemical composition is strongly dependent on protolith composition and, in the case of siliciclastic sediment, the degree of previous chemical depletion. We explore a range of feasible Ca+Mg concentrations for metamorphic rocks and siliciclastic sediment during calibration of the silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM.

\subsection*{Calibration}

The values of four parameters within the silicate weathering component that modify the dependence of silicate weathering on temperature, runoff, erosion, and regolith thickness are poorly constrained. Rather than prescribing single values, we test several reasonable values for each of these four parameters along with the Ca+Mg concentration of metamorphic and siliciclastic lithologies (\SI; Table S2). We then permute all possible combinations of these reasonable values for the six parameters, leading to 93,600 unique parameter combinations (i.e. permutations). For each combination, we compute spatially resolved long-term \COtwo consumption associated with Ca+Mg fluxes using present-day runoff, temperature, and slope. We sum computed \COtwo consumption over watersheds for which data-constrained estimates are available \cite{Gaillardet1999a, Moquet2018a}, then calculate the coefficient of determination ($r^{2}$) between computed and measured \COtwo consumption in each of these watersheds. After eliminating parameter combinations that result in low $r^{2}$, 573 parameter combinations remain (\SI; Fig. S3). The resulting global \COtwo consumption of these filtered model runs all overlap with independently derived estimates of the global \COtwo degassing flux \cite{Gerlach2011a}, as they should given that the long-term carbon cycle is in steady state (\SI; Fig. S3).

\subsection*{Climate Model Component}

Having calibrated the silicate weathering component of GEOCLIM, we use it to estimate the decrease in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with emergence of the SEAI. For the climate model component, we use temperature and runoff from a subset of the GFDL CM2.0 experiments \cite{Delworth2006b} (\SI). These experiments are well-suited for this analysis because all non-\COtwo forcings are held constant at values representative of pre-industrial conditions, allowing the effect of changing \pCOtwo on climatology to be isolated. Furthermore, the experiments were run long enough for the final system to approximate steady-state.

\section*{Paleoshorelines}

    \label{fig:scenario_pCO2}
\end{figure*}

To determine the position of paleoshorelines in the SEAI over the past 15~m.y., we use terrestrial and marine sedimentary deposits (Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}; \SI). The paleoshoreline data indicate that the Sunda-Banda Arc and New Guinea are primarily responsible for the increase in area since 15~Ma. Exhumation of the modern Sunda-Banda Arc is the result of ongoing arc-continent collision with the Australian Plate \cite{Harris2006a}. Most of Sumatra and Java along with the non-volcanic islands of the Outer Banda Arc were elevated above sea level after 5~Ma \cite{Hall2013b}. In New Guinea, emergence in the mid-Miocene is associated with collision between the Melanesian Arc and Australia's distal margin \cite{Cloos2005a}, which drove exhumation of the Irian-Marum-April Ophiolite Belt. Exhumation accelerated over the past 4~m.y. in the New Guinea Central Range due to slab-breakoff and buoyant uplift, and in eastern New Guinea due to jamming of the north-dipping subduction zone \cite{Cloos2005a}. We also include changes in areas of presently submerged continental shelves such as the Sunda Shelf that were previously exposed (\SI; Fig. S6). These tectonic drivers and others throughout the region led to progressive emergence over the past 15~m.y. that accelerated following 5~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}B). This trend mirrors broad cooling over the Neogene that resulted in the initiation of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}C).

We use GEOCLIM to estimate \pCOtwo associated with the reconstructed subaerial extent of the SEAI at ca. 15, 10, and 5~Ma (``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios; Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}). Because we use a climate model forced with modern geography, the position of the tectonic blocks remain fixed. Although there has been motion of these tectonic blocks since 15~Ma, they have remained within tropical latitudes such that this fixed scenario is a good approximation of the paleogeography (\SI; Fig. S9). We also test an end-member scenario, in which all islands associated with arc-continent collision in the region are removed (``removed SEAI'' scenario; Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}).

\section*{\pCOtwo Estimates}

Using the 573 unique parameter combinations, the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios resulted in 526--678~ppm for 15~Ma, 457--516~ppm for 10~Ma, and 391--434~ppm \pCOtwo for 5~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}). These results indicate a progressive decrease in \pCOtwo over the Neogene associated with the emergence of the SEAI, and suggest that without this emergence, pre-industrial \pCOtwo would have been $\sim$526--678~ppm. These ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios do not account for Neogene changes outside of the SEAI (e.g. changes in ocean/atmosphere circulation, volcanic degassing, and weathering fluxes elsewhere on Earth, discussed in \textit{Alternative Mechanisms for Neogene Cooling}). Therefore, these results are not estimating \pCOtwo at 15~Ma, but rather are quantifying \pCOtwo change associated with emergence of the SEAI alone.

Proxy-based estimates of the magnitude and trajectory of \pCOtwo change from the Miocene to the Pliocene are variable between techniques and associated assumptions underlying their interpretation (\SI; Fig. S10). The \pCOtwo values from the 5~Ma ``paleo-SEAI'' scenario overlap with many proxy-based estimates \cite{Foster2017a} as well as values that emerge from approaches that assimilate climate and ice sheet model output with benthic \dO data \cite{van-de-Wal2011a, Berends2020a}. The modeled \pCOtwo values for 15~Ma resemble the higher end of proxy-based \pCOtwo estimates for the early to mid-Miocene, indicating that the increase in subaerially exposed land area and tectonic topography of the SEAI is sufficient to explain long-term cooling of Earth's climate over the Neogene. The \pCOtwo threshold for Antarctic glaciation is estimated to be $\sim$750~ppm with that for Northern Hemisphere glaciation being significantly lower at $\sim$280~ppm \cite{DeConto2008a}. These modeled values of decreasing \pCOtwo associated with emergence of the SEAI are therefore consistent with the record of Neogene climate with Miocene ice sheets on Antarctica \cite{Sugden1995a} followed by Northern Hemisphere ice sheets developing in the Pliocene \cite{Haug2005a} as \pCOtwo subsequently decreased.

The results of our ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios highlight the importance of the combination of topography, runoff, and lithology in setting Earth's climate state. To independently explore the effect of the modern-day surface exposure of lower-relief basaltic lavas on steady-state \pCOtwo \cite{Kent2013a}, we replace mafic volcanics associated with the Deccan Traps, Ethiopian Traps, and Columbia River Basalts with the Ca+Mg concentration of bulk continental crust in GEOCLIM (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}). The resulting \pCOtwo is $\sim$300--500~ppm, indicating that the presence of mafic rocks in these igneous provinces affects steady-state \pCOtwo as has been suggested to be important for Paleogene cooling \cite{Kent2013a}. However, the higher 526--678~ppm values for the 15~Ma ``paleo-SEAI'' scenario illustrate that higher relief and a wet tropical climate significantly increase the efficiency of \COtwo consumption, especially when paired with high Ca+Mg lithologies. As such, arc-continent collisions in the tropics are likely more important for driving long-term changes in \pCOtwo than the eruption of flood basalts \cite{Macdonald2019a, Park2019a}.

Previous work has estimated that the decrease in \pCOtwo since 5~Ma associated with the emergence of the SEAI and enhanced silicate weathering is $\sim$19~ppm \cite{Molnar2015a}, in which case their emergence would be a relatively minor contributor to Neogene cooling. This 19~ppm estimate was obtained using an equation that assumes a direct linear relationship between mean global temperature and changes in weathering-rate-weighted land area, scaled by a factor that is intended to account for the influence of both runoff and temperature. \pCOtwo was then estimated from the calculated temperature using a simple energy balance equation. However, the relationship between mean global temperature (or \pCOtwo) and weathering-rate-weighted land area is not linear. Furthermore, this simple linear relationship ignores spatial variability in topography and climatology, and only crudely accounts for spatial variability in lithology. In fact, the 19~ppm estimate is closer in magnitude to the decrease in \pCOtwo that we estimate if mafic volcanics associated with the Deccan Traps (a relatively flat area outside of the warm and wet tropics) are replaced with the Ca+Mg concentration of bulk continental crust (22--70 ppm; Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}). The significant difference in steady-state \pCOtwo estimated between the ``removed Deccan Traps'' scenario and the ``paleo-SEAI'' scenarios (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}) demonstrates that considering changes in the spatial distribution of lithologies alone is not adequate for estimating changes in steady-state \pCOtwo. Instead, spatially varying topography and climatology significantly modulates silicate weathering rates, and must be accounted for when estimating \pCOtwo change associated with paleogeographic change.

An important caveat for these estimates of \pCOtwo is that our modeling is determining the climatology in the GFDL CM2.0 model at which steady-state is achieved -- a climatology that has an associated \pCOtwo value in the model. However, climate models are variable in their response to changes in \pCOtwo. One way to summarize this variability is through the equilibrium climate sensitivity value -- the steady-state change in global mean surface air temperature associated with a doubling of \pCOtwo. A range of 1.5 to 4.5\degreesC per \pCOtwo doubling was proposed in the landmark Charney report \cite{Charney1979a} and this range was considered to be the credible interval (\textgreater66\% likelihood) in the last IPCC report \cite{Stocker2013a}. Integrating constraints both from understanding of climate feedback processes and the climate record, a recent comprehensive review estimates the 66\% probability range of climate sensitivity to be 2.6 to 3.9\degreesC per \pCOtwo doubling with a 5 to 95\% range of 2.3 to 4.7\degreesC per \pCOtwo doubling \cite{Sherwood2020a}. The equilibrium climate sensitivity associated with the CM2.0 climate models is 2.9\degreesC per \pCOtwo doubling which falls within these ranges although these ranges remain broad. An alternative way to consider the results from our analysis would be that an estimate of 572~ppm (2\times pre-industrial \pCOtwo) for the 15~Ma paleo-SEAI scenario is implying that Earth would be $\sim$2.9\degreesC warmer. If Earth's climate sensitivity is at the higher end of the probable range and higher than in the CM2.0 model, as it is in some climate models, this same amount of Neogene cooling resulting from the emergence of the SEAI could have been driven by a smaller change in \pCOtwo.

\section*{Alternative Mechanisms for Neogene Cooling}

\subsection*{Ocean/Atmosphere Circulation}

Some hypotheses to explain ice sheet growth over the Neogene invoke changes in ocean/atmosphere circulation including: further climatic isolation of Antarctica due to strengthening of the circumpolar current \cite{Shevenell2004a}; increased atmospheric moisture in the Northern Hemisphere due to intensified thermohaline circulation following Panama Isthmus emergence \cite{Haug1998a}; and cooling of North America resulting from a strengthened Walker Circulation associated with emergence of the SEAI \cite{Molnar2015a}. Such changes in ocean/atmosphere circulation are likely to modulate \pCOtwo thresholds for glacial initiation and ice sheet growth \cite{DeConto2008a}. However, the prolonged time-scale of the cooling trend since 15~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}C) is most readily attributable to decreasing \pCOtwo associated with evolving geological sources and sinks of carbon, modulated by the silicate weathering feedback \cite{Walker1981a, Raymo1991a, Berner1997a, Kump1997a, Berner2001a}.

\subsection*{Volcanic Degassing}

A decrease in volcanic degassing \cite{Berner1983a} has also been proposed as a driver for Neogene cooling. However, proxy-based estimates of the evolution of volcanic degassing fluxes throughout the Neogene are inconsistent with each other, such that not even the sign of the change in volcanic degassing over the past $\sim$15~m.y. is without ambiguity \cite{Godderis2017c}. For example, it has both been estimated that the volcanic degassing flux was $\sim$25\% lower \cite{Cogne2006a} and $\sim$10\% higher \cite{Van-Der-Meer2014a} at 15~Ma relative to the present day.

Our model framework provides an opportunity to estimate the decrease in volcanic degassing flux necessary to achieve the same change in \pCOtwo predicted for the increase in global weatherability associated with the emergence of the SEAI over the past 15~m.y. If we use the parameter combination that had the highest $r^{2}$ between computed and measured \COtwo consumption in watersheds around the world during calibration (\textit{Calibration} and \SI; Fig. S4), GEOCLIM estimates a pre-industrial volcanic degassing flux of 4.1$\times$10$^{12}$~mol/yr to balance the silicate weathering flux at 286~ppm \pCOtwo. If we then assume that this volcanic degassing flux did not change over the past 15~m.y., then GEOCLIM estimates that the increase in global weatherability associated with the emergence of the SEAI led to a change in \pCOtwo of $\sim$280~ppm (``increase in weatherability only'' scenario in Fig. \ref{fig:weatherability_curves}). If we instead assume that global weatherability did not change over the past 15~m.y., then we estimate that the volcanic degassing flux needs to have been $\sim$13\% greater at 15~Ma relative to the pre-industrial to drive the same $\sim$280~ppm change in \pCOtwo (``decrease in degassing only'' scenario in Fig. \ref{fig:weatherability_curves}). This $\sim$13\% value is higher than 10\%, the highest current estimate for the volcanic degassing flux at 15~Ma relative to the present day \cite{Van-Der-Meer2014a}.

However, changes in the volcanic degassing flux would have modulated changes in \pCOtwo associated with changes in global weatherability. For example, some proxy-based approaches as well as some model-data assimilation approaches estimate that mid-Miocene \pCOtwo was lower than 568~ppm (\SI; Fig. S10). Take a scenario in which \pCOtwo was 400~ppm at 15~Ma. If we assume that the \pCOtwo decrease to the pre-industrial value of 286~ppm was driven by the increase in global weatherability associated with emergence of the SEAI in conjunction with an increase in volcanic degassing which counteracts cooling by increasing the flux of \COtwo to the atmosphere (``increase in weatherability and degassing'' scenario in Fig. \ref{fig:weatherability_curves}), the volcanic degassing flux would have had to have been $\sim$7\% smaller than the pre-industrial. More robust constraints on \pCOtwo (\SI; Fig. S10) and/or volcanic degassing rates over the past 20~m.y. are needed to constrain which of the ``increase in weatherability only'' or ``increase in weatherability and degassing'' scenarios (Fig. \ref{fig:weatherability_curves}) is more representative of the mechanisms driving Neogene cooling.

Details on how these curves were generated are described in \MM. Each of the 4 curves represent a different tectonic boundary condition (i.e. the reconstructed paleoshorelines of the SEAI; Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}A) and therefore a different global weatherability. The curves show the resulting \pCOtwo for a given volcanic degassing flux such that the input flux is balanced by the silicate weathering output flux. Point B represents the pre-industrial, in which \pCOtwo is 286~ppm. The arrow from Point A$_{1}$ to B represents the ``increase in weatherability only'' scenario, in which global weatherability increases as the SEAI emerge, but the volcanic degassing flux does not change over the past 15~m.y. In this scenario, the \pCOtwo decreases from the value dictated by the 15~Ma ``paleo-SEAI'' weatherability curve (568~ppm). The arrow from Point A$_{2}$ to B instead represents the ``decrease in degassing only'' scenario, in which global weatherability remains the same as the pre-industrial, but the same change in \pCOtwo as the ``increase in weatherability only'' scenario is achieved by decreasing the volcanic degassing flux from a value $\sim$13\% greater than the pre-industrial. The arrow from Point A$_{3}$ to B represents the ``increase in weatherability and degassing'' scenario, in which a change in \pCOtwo from 400~ppm to 286~ppm is achieved by increasing both global weatherability from our 15~Ma tectonic boundary condition as well as the volcanic degassing flux from a value $\sim$7\% smaller than the pre-industrial flux.}

\subsection*{Himalayan Uplift}

Marine \SrSr has overall been increasing since ca. 35~Ma \cite{McArthur2012a}. The traditional explanation for this trend is that it reflects increased weathering of radiogenic (i.e. high \SrSr) silicate rocks \cite{Raymo1988a}. Associated with this explanation is the proposal that increasing weathering of radiogenic silicate rocks in the Himalayas was the primary driver of Neogene cooling \cite{Raymo1992a, Edmond1992a}. It could be argued that increasing marine \SrSr is inconsistent with the hypothesis that increasing weathering of juvenile (i.e. low \SrSr) silicate rocks in the SEAI was an important driver of Neogene cooling. However, the globally averaged ratio of silicate weathering fluxes from radiogenic cratonic rocks versus juvenile arc lithologies can be at least partially decoupled from marine \SrSr via the regional weathering of isotopically unique lithologies. For example, unusually radiogenic carbonates are abundant in Himalayan strata, and it is estimated that $\sim$75\% of Sr coming from the Himalayas can be attributed to carbonate rather than silicate weathering \cite{Jacobson2002a, Quade2003a, Oliver2003a}. As such, there are challenges in interpreting the marine \SrSr record as a direct proxy for silicate weathering fluxes. Nevertheless, steadily increasing marine \SrSr is interrupted ca. 16~Ma when the slope of the \SrSr curve decreases \cite{McArthur2012a}. This decrease in slope has been attributed to coincident exhumation of relatively low \SrSr Outer Lesser Himalaya carbonates \cite{Myrow2015a, Colleps2018a}, but could also be at least partially driven by the emergence of low \SrSr lithologies in the SEAI during arc-continent collision. Increasing seawater Mg/Ca since ca. 15~Ma \cite{Higgins2012a} is consistent with an increasing proportion of the global silicate weathering flux being derived from mafic and ultramafic sources.

Himalayan uplift would have affected geological carbon sinks, either via increased weathering of silicate rocks \cite{Raymo1992a} or enhanced burial of organic matter in the Bengal Fan \cite{Galy2007a}. Increased weathering of the emerging SEAI would have occurred in tandem with such changes in the Himalaya, such that the effects of these paleogeographic changes on geochemical proxy records, like marine \SrSr, become difficult to disentangle. In addition, given the large uncertainty associated with changes in regional climatology across Asia due to Himalayan orogeny, developing quantitative estimates of the evolution of global silicate weathering fluxes associated with Himalayan orogeny remains a major challenge.

\section*{The Geologic Carbon Cycle}

If geological carbon sources remain approximately constant, global alkalinity delivery from silicate weathering needs to be approximately constant as well to keep the long-term carbon cycle in steady-state \cite{Kump1997a}. Enhanced silicate weathering in a region such as the SEAI is compensated by a decrease in silicate weathering elsewhere. Global alkalinity delivery from silicate weathering does not change, but occurs more efficiently and thereby at lower \pCOtwo. Given that carbonate weathering is disconnected from the long-term carbon-cycle mass balance, changes in carbonate accumulation through time \cite{Si2019a} could be driven by changes in carbonate weathering.

The long-term carbon-cycle mass balance can be perturbed via mechanisms that are disconnected from changes in volcanic degassing and silicate weathering rates. For example, sulphide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution could act as a source of \COtwo on million year time-scales \cite{Torres2014a}. Similarly, the weathering of sedimentary organic matter could serve as a source of \COtwo \cite{Hilton2014a}. On the other hand, enhanced burial of organic matter enabled by higher sediment and nutrient delivery could be an important sink of \COtwo, as has been suggested in the Bengal Fan \cite{Galy2007a} and Taiwan \cite{Kao2014a}. The fluxes of \COtwo represented by these processes are not accounted for in our model framework, and could have been affected by emergence of the SEAI and/or Himalayan orogeny. \pCOtwo changes that result from these processes would be superimposed on \pCOtwo changes associated with evolving silicate weathering rates. However, our coupled weathering-climate model indicates that the \pCOtwo change associated with evolving silicate weathering rates driven by emergence of the SEAI is sufficient to explain the majority of Neogene cooling (Fig. \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2}). Without this emergence, \pCOtwo would have remained above the level necessary for the growth of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.

\section*{Conclusions}

Coupled geological constraints and modeling experiments demonstrate that the SEAI have been a growing hot spot for carbon sequestration due to silicate weathering from the Miocene to present. Changes in volcanic degassing and paleogeography elsewhere on Earth, particularly in the Himalaya and Central America, would have also affected geological carbon sources and sinks. Yet, not only does the history of emergence of the SEAI coincide with Neogene cooling and the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but our coupled weathering-climate model also indicates that the associated steady-state \pCOtwo change is sufficient to explain much of this cooling. These results highlight that the Earth's climate state is particularly sensitive to changes in tropical geography.

\subsection*{GEOCLIM Silicate Weathering Component}

The silicate weathering component of the GEOCLIM model has been modified from the previously published version \cite{Godderis2017b}. The new component implements the model of Gabet and Mudd (2009) \cite{Gabet2009a} for the development of a chemically weathered profile. We refer to this chemically weathered profile as regolith where the base of the regolith is unweathered bedrock. In the model of Gabet and Mudd (2009), material enters the regolith and leaves either as a solute through chemical weathering of the material during its travel from the bedrock towards the surface, or as a physically weathered particle once it reaches the top. We use the DynSoil implementation of the Gabet and Mudd (2009) model, which integrates chemical weathering within the regolith \cite{West2012a}. The transient time-varying version of this regolith model is described by three equations:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dh}{dt} = P_{r} - E_{p}
    \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = -P_{r} \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} - K \tau^{\sigma}x
    \label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t} = -P_{r} \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial z} + 1
    \label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Equation \ref{eq:1} is a statement of material conservation, where $h$ is the total height of the regolith (m), $t$ is the model time (yr), $P_{r}$ is the regolith production rate (m/yr), and $E_{p}$ is the physical erosion rate (m/yr). Equation \ref{eq:2} describes how the residual fraction of weatherable phases ($x$, unitless) changes as a function of time ($t$, yr) and depth ($z$, m). $K \tau^{\sigma}$ is the dissolution rate constant, which depends on the local climate (captured by $K$, yr$^{-1-\sigma}$) and the time that a given rock particle has spent in the regolith ($\tau$, yr) to some power $\sigma$ (unitless) which implements a time-dependence. Equation \ref{eq:3} describes how the time that a given rock particle has spent in the regolith changes as time in the model progresses.

The net weathering rate in the regolith column ($W$, m/yr) can then be calculated with:

\begin{equation}
    W = \int_{0}^{h} K \tau^{\sigma} x\;dz
    \label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

The regolith production rate can be expressed as the product of the optimal production rate ($P_{0}$) and a soil production function ($f(h)$):

\begin{equation}
    P_{r} = P_{0}\;f(h)
    \label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    P_{0} = k_{rp}\;q\;e^{-\frac{E_{a}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_{0}}\right)}
    \label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f(h) = e^{\frac{-h}{d_{0}}}
    \label{eq:7}
\end{equation}

\noindent
$P_{0}$ is the `optimal' regolith production rate (m/yr), which is defined to be the regolith production rate when there is no overlying regolith. In Equation \ref{eq:6}, where $k_{rp}$ is a proportionality constant (unitless), $q$ is the runoff (m/yr), $E_{a}$ is the activation energy (J/K/mol), $R$ is the ideal gas constant (J/mol), $T$ is the temperature (K), and $T_{0}$ is the reference temperature (K), we parameterize the `optimal' regolith production rate \cite{Carretier2014a}. $f(h)$ is the soil production function (unitless), which describes how regolith production decreases as the thickness of the regolith increases. It takes an exponential form as is commonly applied in the literature \cite{Gabet2009a}. In Equation \ref{eq:7}, $d_{0}$ is a reference regolith thickness (m) \cite{Heimsath1997a}.

Our implementation of the erosion rate is parameterized based on runoff and slope ($s$; m/m):

\begin{equation}
    E_{p} = k_{e}\;q^{m}\;s^{n}
    \label{eq:8}
\end{equation}

\noindent
$k_{e}$ is a proportionality constant ((m/yr)$^{1-m}$) and $m$ and $n$ are adjustable exponents that are kept as 0.5 and 1 \cite{Maffre2018a}. This formulation is directly inspired by the stream power law \cite{Davy2000a}. This formulation and these exponent values are supported by compilations, but variability in the proportionality constant is difficult to capture at a global scale \cite{Lague2013a}.

The $K$ in the dissolution rate constant in Equation \ref{eq:2} describes the dependence of the chemical weathering on climate:

\begin{equation}
    K = k_{d}\left(1-e^{-k_{w}q}\right)e^{-\frac{E_{a}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_{0}}\right)}
    \label{eq:9}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Equation \ref{eq:9} is an empirical simplification of mineral dissolution rates derived from kinetic theory and laboratory experiments \cite{West2012a}, where $k_{d}$ is a proportionality constant that modifies the dependence of dissolution rate on runoff and temperature (yr$^{-1-\sigma}$), and $k_{w}$ is a proportionality constant that modifies the dependence of dissolution rate on runoff (yr/m).

In this study, we are interested in obtaining the steady-state solution rather than the transient time-varying solution. The steady-state solution for DynSoil can be calculated analytically by setting the time derivatives equal to zero resulting in the following set of equations:

\begin{equation}
    h = \max\left(0,\;d_{0} \log\left(\frac{P_{0}}{E_{p}}\right)\right)
    \label{eq:10}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    x(z) = \exp\left(-\frac{K}{\sigma+1}\left(\frac{z}{E_{p}}\right)^{\sigma+1}\right)
    \label{eq:11}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = E_{p}(1-x(h)) = E_{p}(1-x_s)
    \label{eq:12}
\end{equation}

\noindent
$x(z)$ is the abundance profile of primary phases inside the regolith, varying with height upward from the base of the regolith as shown in Figure \ref{fig:regolith_schematic}. Setting $z$ equal to the regolith thickness ($h$) gives $x_s$ which is the proportion of primary phases remaining at the top of the regolith column.

\subsection*{Weatherability Curves}

To create the 15~Ma ``paleo-SEAI'' curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:weatherability_curves}, we use the reconstructed paleoshorelines of the SEAI at 15~Ma (Fig. \ref{fig:shoreline_growth}A). We then select the parameter combination that had the highest $r^{2}$ between computed and measured \COtwo consumption in watersheds around the world during calibration (\textit{Calibration} and \SI; Fig. S4), and fix \pCOtwo at the 3 \pCOtwo levels at which the GFDL CM2.0 climate model experiments were computed (\SI). We then run GEOCLIM at each of these \pCOtwo levels until steady state is achieved (i.e. until the volcanic degassing flux is equal to the silicate weathering flux). We then repeat this process for the 10 and 5~Ma ``paleo-SEAI'' paleoshorelines and the present day shorelines to generate the 3 other weatherability curves. Each estimated \pCOtwo in Figure \ref{fig:scenario_pCO2} is the result of underlying weatherability curves that change with the different chemical weathering parameters.

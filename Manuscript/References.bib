@article{Macdonald2019a,
	Abstract = {On multi-million-year timescales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown if transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in CO2 sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by uplifting and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth{\textquoteright}s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice-sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth{\textquoteright}s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.},

	Abstract = {Anomalous sulfur isotopic compositions preserved in sedimentary rocks older than \~{}2.5 billion years have been widely interpreted as the products of UV photolysis of sulfur dioxide in an anoxic atmosphere and used to track the history of primitive Earth and evolution of early life. In this study, we present strong observational evidence that there is an additional process that produces similar anomalous sulfur isotope signatures. This previously unknown origin not only offers a tool for quantifying the present-day atmospheric sulfur budget and evaluating its influences on climate and public health but also implies that anomalous sulfur isotopic compositions in some of the oldest rocks on Earth might have been produced in a way different from that previously thought.The signature of mass-independent fractionation of quadruple sulfur stable isotopes (S-MIF) in Archean rocks, ice cores, and Martian meteorites provides a unique probe of the oxygen and sulfur cycles in the terrestrial and Martian paleoatmospheres. Its mechanistic origin, however, contains some uncertainties. Even for the modern atmosphere, the primary mechanism responsible for the S-MIF observed in nearly all tropospheric sulfates has not been identified. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of a fifth sulfur isotope, stratospherically produced radiosulfur, along with all four stable sulfur isotopes in the same sulfate aerosols and a suite of chemical species to define sources and mechanisms on a field observational basis. The five-sulfur-isotope and multiple chemical species analysis approach provides strong evidence that S-MIF signatures in tropospheric sulfates are concomitantly affected by two distinct processes: an altitude-dependent positive 33S anomaly, likely linked to stratospheric SO2 photolysis, and a negative 36S anomaly mainly associated with combustion. Our quadruple stable sulfur isotopic measurements in varying coal samples (formed in the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic periods) and in SO2 emitted from combustion display normal 33S and 36S, indicating that the observed negative 36S anomalies originate from a previously unknown S-MIF mechanism during combustion (likely recombination reactions) instead of coal itself. The basic chemical physics of S-MIF in both photolytic and thermal reactions and their interplay, which were not explored together in the past, may be another ingredient for providing deeper understanding of the evolution of Earth{\textquoteright}s atmosphere and life{\textquoteright}s origin.},

	Abstract = {The Arabian-Nubian Shield froms the suture between East and West Gondwana at the northern end of the East African Orogen (EAO). The older components of the shield include Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic continental crust, and Neoproterozoic (c.870{\textendash}670Ma) continental-marginal and juvenile intraoceanic magmatic-arc terranes that accumulated in an oceanic environment referred to as the Mozambique Ocean. Subduction, starting c. 870 Ma, and initial arc-arc convergence and terrane suturing at c. 780 Ma, marked the beginning of ocean-basin closure and Gondwana assembly. Terrane amalgamation continued until c. 600 Ma, resulting in the juxtaposition of East and West Gondwana across the deformed rocks of the shield, and final assembly of Gondwana was achieved by c. 550 Ma following overlapping periods of basin formation, rifting, compression, strike-slip faulting, and the creation of gneiss domes in association with extension and/or thrusting. Most post-amalgamation basin contain molasse deposits, but those in the eastern Arabian Shield and Oman have marine to glaciomarine deposits, which indicate that seaways penetrated the orogen soon after orogeny. The varied character of the post-amalgamation events militate against any simple tectonic model of final Gondwana convergence at the northern end of the EAO, and requires that models accommodate alternating periods of Late Neoproterozoic extension and shortening, uplift and depression, deposition and erosion.},

	N2 = {Abstract Large polar motions are observed in the apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) of several continents during the Ediacaran. Among various hypotheses proposed in the literature, one consists of the occurrence of two successive fast and large True Polar Wander (TPW) episodes, from 615 to 590 Ma and then between 575 and 565 Ma. In this study, we explored the effect of the reactivation of a girdle of subduction to produce such TPW. First, we performed a reconstruction of the main continents between 615 and 520 Ma including Laurentia, Baltica, West and Central Gondwana, and Australia-Antarctica. We then implemented this paleogeography into a simple mantle dynamic model to calculate the TPW during the Ediacaran. Our results show that the reactivation of a girdle of subduction surrounding the continents along with a reduced effect of the return flow rising from the lower mantle can produce two TPW episodes consistent with the paleomagnetic observations. This mechanism is possible if the sinking velocities associated with the girdle of subduction drastically decrease between 635 and 730 Ma. Such a large geodynamic event is consistent with the detrital zircon age distribution of the Neoproterozoic supporting a low subduction activity during the Cryogenian and a boost during the Ediacaran. Decrease of subduction-related stress induced on the lithosphere may have interrupted the rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia for 100 Ma. Finally, the weakening in subduction magmatism might have strongly reduced the CO2 flux into the atmosphere and played a major role in driving the Neoproterozoic global-scale glaciations.},

@article{Liu2018a,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe influence of continental topography on the initiation of a global glaciation (i.e. snowball Earth) is studied with both a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM), CCSM3, and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), CAM3 coupled to a slab ocean model. It is found that when the climate is very cold, snow cover over the central region of the Eurasian continent decreases when the atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2) is reduced. In the coupled model, this constitutes a negative feedback due to the reduction of land surface albedo that counteracts the positive feedback due to sea-ice expansion towards the equator. When the solar insolation is 94\% of the present-day value, the Earth enters a snowball state when pCO2 is ~35 ppmv. On the other hand, if the continents are assumed to be flat topographically (with the global mean elevation as in the more realistic present-day case), the Earth enters a snowball state more easily at pCO2 = ~60 ppmv. Therefore, the presence of topography may increase the stability of Earth against descent into a snowball state. On the contrary, a snowball Earth is found to form much more easily when complex topography is present than when it is not in CAM3. This happens despite the fact that the mid- to high-latitude climate is much warmer (by ~10 $\,^{\circ}$C) when topography is present than when it is not. Analyses show that neglecting sea ice dynamics in this model prevents the warming anomaly in the mid to high latitude from being efficiently transmitted into the tropics. },

@article{Shellnutt2012a,
	Abstract = {The Mesoproterozoic ({\textasciitilde}1.23 Ga) Sudbury dyke swarm was emplaced at equatorial latitudes and cross-cuts the Grenville, Southern and Superior Provinces of the Canadian Shield. The dyke swarm has been linked to the break-up of the Mesoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia (1.8 to 1.3 Ga). The Sudbury dykes are alkaline olivine diabases that extend {\textasciitilde}300 km to the W and NW from the Grenville Front. Major element trends and MELTS modeling indicate fractional crystallization of olivine and plagioclase. Detailed mineral chemical analyses across a 90-m-wide dyke shows a symmetric M-shaped pattern indicating vertical flow differentiation. The highest measured Fo value of olivine from the chilled margin of one dyke is 70, suggesting the parental magmas of the dykes were evolved. Unlike other dykes of the Canadian Shield, the Sudbury dykes do not show significant chemical variation across the length of the swarm. The Sudbury dykes have high Sr/Y (>10), La/YbN (>5) and Sm/YbPM (>2.4) values indicating they originated from a garnet-bearing source. The low Th/Nb (<1.5) values contrast with the low Nb/La (<0.6) and La/Ba ({\textasciitilde}0.4) values, suggesting a possible lithospheric mantle or subduction-modified mantle source. In the context of Grenvillian tectonics, the Sudbury dykes intruded the Laurentian craton and parautochthonous rocks. The dykes occupy pre-existing west to northwest trending faults, suggesting that they exploited regional structural heterogeneities during the closure of the Elzevir basin (i.e., 1,250 to 1,190 Ma). The alkaline composition, limited spatial-chemical variation, volume, geometry and regional geological context suggest that the dykes are not likely related to a mantle plume or the break-up of a supercontinent.},

These contemporaneous magmatic events occurred while the Rodinia supercontinent was being assembled and are inferred to be parts of a single large igneous province emplaced across the two cratons. Widespread intraplate magmatism during Rodinia assembly shows that mantle upwellings required to generate such provinces may occur independently of the supercontinent cycle.},

	N2 = {Although geological comparisons between Australia and North America have provided a basis for various Neoproterozoic Rodinia reconstructions, quantitative support from precisely dated palaeomagnetic poles has so far been lacking. We report U?Pb ages and palaeomagnetic results for two suites of mafic sills within the intracratonic Bangemall Basin of Western Australia, one of which is dated at 1070?$\pm$?6?Ma and carries a high-stability palaeomagnetic remanence. Comparison of the Bangemall palaeopole with Laurentian data suggests that previous reconstructions of eastern Australia against either western Canada (SWEAT) or the western United States (AUSWUS) are not viable at 1070?Ma. This implies that the Pacific Ocean did not form by separation of Australia?Antarctica from Laurentia, and that up to 10?000?km of late Neoproterozoic passive margins need to be matched with other continental blocks within any proposed Rodinia supercontinent. Our results permit a reconstruction (AUSMEX) that closely aligns late Mesoproterozoic orogenic belts in north-east Australia and southernmost Laurentia.},

	N2 = {Uplift of the Himalayas has been proposed to have locally accelerated chemical weathering, thus leading to enhanced CO2 sequestration and global cooling. This hypothesis assumes that rapid erosion exposes fresh, highly reactive minerals at Earth's surface. Empirical studies quantifying the relationship between erosion and weathering have produced apparently conflicting results, where the nature of the relationship is dependent on the weathering regime of the sampled landscapes. We derive a quantitative model that defines this relationship across the range of weathering regimes, from supply-limited to kinetically limited conditions. The model matches trends in field data collected by others and reconciles apparently conflicting results. The model also demonstrates that, as erosion rates increase, potential increases in weathering rate from the exposure of fresher materials are offset by the decrease in the total volume of minerals exposed due to thinner regolith. We conclude that the relationship between weathering and erosion is one of diminishing returns, in which increases in erosion rate lead to progressively smaller increases in weathering rate; indeed, at the highest erosion rates, weathering rates may decline. The ability, therefore, of accelerated uplift and erosion to stimulate greater CO2 sequestration may be significant in landscapes eroding at rates of 100--102 t km−2 yr−1. However, where erosion rates are greater than 102 t km−2 yr−1, increases in denudation may not be matched by increases in chemical weathering. Finally, our results suggest that watersheds with regolith thicknesses of \~{}0.5 m will yield the greatest solute fluxes.},

	N2 = {We present four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates, and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins as geographic and Mercator grids with 2 arc min resolution. The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate, and asymmetry at each grid node are determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps toward hot spots. We also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using three alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of our digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represents a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.},

	N2 = {Diabase and basalt were reacted with Na-Ca-K-Cl fluids of seawater chlorinity at 375?425$\,^{\circ}$C, 375?400 bars, and fluid/rock mass ratios of 0.5?1.0 to assess the role of basalt chemistry and texture on Sr and Ca mobility during high-temperature hydrothermal alteration. An additional experiment, utilizing an 84Sr spiked fluid, was performed to help quantify reaction rates of processes affecting Sr mobility. The experimental results help to constrain reaction processes responsible for the chemistry of hot spring fluids at midocean ridges. Alteration of basalt and diabase is characterized by formation of tremolite-actinolite-smectite-chlorite and clinozoisitic epidote-smectite-chlorite, respectively. Diabase alteration produced dissolved Sr/Ca ratios similar to those observed for ridge crest hot spring fluids, whereas alteration of a mostly crystalline basalt produced significantly lower ratios. This observation supports the premise that the Sr/Ca ratios observed in vent fluids may be produced during deep-seated reaction of the hydrothermal fluids with diabase dikes and/or gabbro at relatively low fluid/rock ratios and suggests that hydrothermal alteration of primary igneous minerals at relatively high temperatures (400$\,^{\circ}$C) leads to formation of a mineral with low DSr/Ca, Possibly hydrothermal plagioclase. Results of the 84Sr spiked experiment indicated that only 4{\%} of the Sr in basalt was mobilized after 800 hours of reaction despite the fact that B and Li were nearly quantitatively leached. It is thus suggested that B and Li are good indicators of the amount of fresh rock encountered by fluids, while Sr concentration and isotopic data can be used to estimate the degree of alteration that the Sr-bearing primary minerals have undergone. The degree of alteration of subsurface reservoirs may be estimated by dividing the fluid/rock ratio obtained for highly mobile elements by the fluid/rock ratio obtained from path-integrated Sr isotope and concentration data. Based on this method, for example, it can be estimated that only 5{\%} of the primary Sr-bearing minerals encountered by fluids in the subsurface at EPR 21$\,^{\circ}$N are actually converted to secondary phases.},

	N2 = {Abstract Chlorophyll-based photosynthesis has fuelled the biosphere since at least the early Archean, but it was the ecological takeover of oxygenic cyanobacteria in the early Palaeoproterozoic, and of photosynthetic eukaryotes in the late Neoproterozoic, that gave rise to a recognizably modern ocean?atmosphere system. The fossil record offers a unique view of photosynthesis in deep time, but is deeply compromised by differential preservation and non-diagnostic morphologies. The pervasively polyphyletic expression of modern cyanobacterial phenotypes means that few Proterozoic fossils are likely to be members of extant clades; rather than billion-year stasis, their similarity to modern counterparts is better interpreted as a combination of serial convergence and extinction, facilitated by high levels of horizontal gene transfer. There are few grounds for identifying cyanobacterial akinetes or crown-group Nostocales in the Proterozoic record. Such recognition undermines the results of various ancestral state reconstruction analyses, as well as molecular clock estimates calibrated against demonstrably problematic Proterozoic fossils. Eukaryotic organisms are likely to have acquired their (stem-group nostocalean) photoendosymbionts/plastids by at least the Palaeoproterozoic, but remained ecologically marginalized by incumbent cyanobacteria until the late Neoproterozoic appearance of suspension-feeding animals.},

	Abstract = {Orthochemical sediments associated with Neoproterozoic glaciation have prominence beyond their volumetric proportions because of the insights they provide on the nature of glaciation and the records they hold of the environment in which they were precipitated. Synglacial Fe formations are mineralogically simple (haematite jaspilite), and their trace element spectra resemble modern seawater, with a weaker hydrothermal signature than Archaean{\textendash}Palaeoproterozoic Fe formations. Lithofacies associations implicate subglacial meltwater plumes as the agents of Fe(II) oxidation, and temporal oscillations in the plume flux as the cause of alternating Fe- and Mn-oxide deposits. Most if not all Neoproterozoic examples belong to the older Cryogenian (Sturtian) glaciation. Older and younger Cryogenian (Marinoan) cap carbonates are distinct. Only the younger have well-developed transgressive cap dolostones, which were laid down during the rise in global mean sea level resulting from ice-sheet meltdown. Marinoan cap dolostones have a suite of unusual sedimentary structures, indicating abnormal palaeoenvironmental conditions during their deposition. Assuming the meltdown of ice-sheets was rapid, cap dolostones were deposited from surface waters dominated by buoyant glacial meltwater, within and beneath which microbial activity probably catalysed dolomite nucleation. Former aragonite seafloor cement (crystal fans) found in deeper water limestone above Marinoan cap dolostones indicates carbonate oversaturation at depth, implying extreme concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon. Barite is associated with a number of Marinoan cap dolostones, either as digitate seafloor cement associated with Fe-dolomite at the top of the cap dolostone, or as early diagenetic void-filling cement associated with tepee or tepee-like breccias. Seafloor barite marks a redoxcline in the water column across which euxinic Ba-rich waters upwelled, causing simultaneous barite titration and Fe(III) reduction. Phosphatic stromatolites, shrub-like structures and coated grains are associated with a glacioisostatically induced exposure surface on a cap dolostone in the NE of the West African craton, but this appears to be a singular occurrence of phosphorite formed during a Neoproterozoic deglaciation.},

@article{Ye2018a,
	Abstract = {Paleoredox reconstructions of Neoproterozoic successions have been the subject of long-standing debates, especially concerning the precise timing of ocean ventilation and its causal relationship, if any, with the evolution of early animal life. Sponge biomarkers and putative sponge-like body fossils have been found from rocks in the Cryogenian Period, yet the contemporaneous deep-water conditions remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we report pyrite morphology, trace metal enrichments, and total organic carbon data from interglacial black shales of the lower Datangpo Formation at Daotuo area, northeast Guizhou Province, South China. A contrasting Mo--U enrichments pattern emerges from the basal Datangpo black shales, despite the persistently euxinic local environment as testified by the presence of abundant tiny pyrite framboids. Molybdenum is markedly enriched in the basal interval and its concentration decreases sharply up section, while uranium stays relatively constant at crustal concentrations throughout the entire profile. This decoupled Mo--U signature, integrated with a simple mass balance model, suggests that euxinia only covered a small proportion of the dominantly ferruginous global seafloor, thus allowing dissolved Mo to accumulate to significant level in seawater. The enrichment degrees of Mo, although nontrivial, are still much lower than those from Phanerozoic equivalents. Contrarily, they are quite close to the total mean abundance for Mesoproterozoic euxinic shales. Such a mild increase of marine Mo--U inventory is therefore inferred as recording no dramatic rise in oxygen levels following the Sturtian glaciation. A drop of Mo contents after the basal interval could represent either limited Mo availability or inadequate hydrogen sulfide supply.},

	Abstract = {Well-preserved siliciclastic biolaminites from the Neoproterozoic Wuqiangxi Formation (ca. 810--715 Ma) in South China show submillimeter-scaled couplets that consist of alternating dark and light laminae. The laminar couplets have been interpreted of annual origin, and the dark and light laminae mainly record warm spring to summer and cold autumn to winter deposition, respectively. Power spectrum and evolutionary fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses of the laminar couplet thickness variations and geochemical series (Al, Th, Ba/Ti, Cu/Ti, Zn/Ti, V/Ti and U/Ti) revealed prominent periodicity of 10.0--11.4 yr and 18.9--25.6 yr. These two coherent periodic modes match well with the 11-yr Schwabe sunspot cycle and 22-yr solar Hale cycle, respectively. The observed layering pattern is thus interpreted as recording solar induced climate changes that may have modulated sedimentation, microbial growth and biomass production in shallow marine environments between fair-weather and storm-wave bases. Preservation of the sunspot cycles may have been facilitated by quiet depositional environment, microbial mat protection, and early diagenetic silicification. The documented Neoproterozoic cyclicity, in combination with previously reported examples, implies the stability of sunspot periodicity since the Paleoproterozoic. The presence of stable sunspot cycles in the upper Wuqiangxi Formation also suggests that the solar activity did not change significantly at the dawn of the Sturtian glaciation.},

@article{Winnick2018a,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that thermodynamic limitations on chemical weathering rates exert a first-order control on riverine solute fluxes and by extension, global chemical weathering rates. As such, these limitations may play a prominent role in the regulation of carbon dioxide levels (pCO2) over geologic timescales by constraining the maximum global weathering flux. In this study, we develop a theoretical scaling relationship between equilibrium solute concentrations and pCO2 based on equilibrium constants and reaction stoichiometry relating primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation. We test this theoretical scaling relationship against reactive transport simulations of chemical weathering profiles under open- and closed-system conditions, representing partially and fully water-saturated regolith, respectively. Under open-system conditions, equilibrium bicarbonate concentrations vary as a power-law function of pCO2(y=kxn) where n is dependent on reaction stoichiometry and k is dependent on both reaction stoichiometry and the equilibrium constant. Under closed-system conditions, bicarbonate concentrations vary linearly with pCO2 at low values and approach open-system scaling at high pCO2. To describe the potential role of thermodynamic limitations in the global silicate weathering feedback, we develop a new mathematical framework to assess weathering feedback strength in terms of both (1) steady-state atmospheric pCO2 concentrations, and (2) susceptibility to secular changes in degassing rates and transient carbon cycle perturbations, which we term 1st and 2nd order feedback strength, respectively. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the effects of vascular land plant evolution on feedback strength, the potential role of vegetation in controlling modern solute fluxes, and the application of these frameworks to a more complete functional description of the silicate weathering feedback. Most notably, the dependence of equilibrium solute concentrations on pCO2 may represent a direct weathering feedback largely independent of climate and modulated by belowground organic carbon respiration.},

@article{Maher2014a,
	Abstract = {When the silicate-rich rocks and minerals in Earth{\textquoteright}s interior are uplifted and exposed to Earth{\textquoteright}s surface, they dissolve. On a geologic time scale, this chemical weathering process ultimately creates a sink for CO2, thereby influencing global temperatures. Maher and Chamberlain (p. 1502, published online 13 March) developed a theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental relationship between weathering, tectonics, and the geological carbon cycle. The analysis suggests that temperature plays less of a role in regulating chemical weathering{\textemdash}which is dependent on the balance of tectonic uplift and erosion{\textemdash}than runoff on continents and the time that silicate minerals are exposed to fluids. Plateaus in weathering fluxes with increasing runoff or temperature allows for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 despite high rates of uplift or erosion.Earth{\textquoteright}s temperature is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback between atmospheric CO2 levels and chemical weathering of silicate rocks that operates over million-year time scales. To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.},

	Abstract = {The question addressed here is whether global chemical weathering and erosion rates have increased over Cenozoic time in response to uplift of the Himalayas.1--2 Chemical weathering of the continents is a process whereby carbonic acid (derived from the atmosphere or from soil respiration and decomposition) is consumed. Thus it represents a sink for atmospheric CO2 and provides one link between uplift and climate change. The prevailing hypothesis concerning the cause of the long-term cooling of Cenozoic climates states that as a result of increased rates of silicate weathering, atmospheric CO2 levels have fallen, the magnitude of the greenhouse effect has been reduced, and thus the globally averaged climate has cooled. Such a scenario is consistent with the secular record of seawater Sr isotopic composition preserved in carbonates1,3--6 (Fig. la), which becomes increasingly radiogenic with time through the Cenozoic. This trend implies a growing influence of continental weathering, relative to seafloor hydrothermal activity, on the Sr isotopic composition of seawater.7            },

	Abstract = {Abstract The areal extent of the Maritime Continent (the islands of Indonesia and surrounding region) has grown larger by ~60\% since 5 Ma. We argue that this growth might have altered global climate in two ways that would have contributed to making recurring Ice Ages possible. First, because rainfall over the islands of the Maritime Continent not only is heavier than that over the adjacent ocean but also correlates with the strength of the Walker Circulation, the growth of the Maritime Continent since 5 Ma may have contributed to the cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific since that time. Scaling relationships between the strength of the Walker Circulation and rainfall over the islands of the Maritime Continent and between sea surface temperature (SST) of the eastern tropical Pacific and the strength of easterly wind stress suggest that the increase in areal extent of islands would lead to a drop in that SST of 0.75$\,^{\circ}$C. Although only a fraction of the 3--4$\,^{\circ}$C decrease in SSTs between the eastern and western tropical Pacific, the growth of the Maritime Continent may have strengthened the Walker Circulation, increased the east-west temperature gradient across the Pacific and thereby enabled ice sheets to wax and wane over Canada since 3 Ma. Second, because the weathering of basaltic rock under warm, moist conditions extracts CO2 from the atmosphere more rapidly than weathering of other rock or of basalt under cooler or drier conditions, the increase in weathering due to increasing area of basalt in the Maritime Continent may have drawn down enough CO2 from the atmosphere to affect global temperatures. Simple calculations suggest that increased weathering of basalt might have lowered global temperatures by 0.25$\,^{\circ}$C, possibly important for the overall cooling.},

	Abstract = { Southeast (SE) Asia is surrounded by subduction zones causing intense seismicity and volcanic activity. Subduction has been the principal tectonic driver of collisions that caused the growth of continental SE Asia, and most recently the collision of Australia with SE Asia. The western part of SE Asia, Sundaland, is a heterogeneous and weak region, reflecting processes that can be observed today in the east, where there are subduction zones in different stages of development. A close relationship between subduction rollback and extension has caused dramatic elevation of land, exhumation of deep crust, and spectacular subsidence of basins, observable with remotely acquired images and seismic and multibeam data obtained from oil exploration. New dating indicates that subsidence and uplift occurred at high rates during short time intervals. Laboratory studies, modeling, and reconstructions provide valuable insights, but field-based studies continue to present surprises and new discoveries essential for interpretations of the geological history of the region. },

	Abstract = {Lithology describes the geochemical, mineralogical, and physical properties of rocks. It plays a key role in many processes at the Earth surface, especially the fluxes of matter to soils, ecosystems, rivers, and oceans. Understanding these processes at the global scale requires a high resolution description of lithology. A new high resolution global lithological map (GLiM) was assembled from existing regional geological maps translated into lithological information with the help of regional literature. The GLiM represents the rock types of the Earth surface with 1,235,400 polygons. The lithological classification consists of three levels. The first level contains 16 lithological classes comparable to previously applied definitions in global lithological maps. The additional two levels contain 12 and 14 subclasses, respectively, which describe more specific rock attributes. According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64\% sediments (a third of which are carbonates), 13\% metamorphics, 7\% plutonics, and 6\% volcanics, and 10\% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales. A gridded version of the GLiM is available at the PANGEA Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.788537).},

	Abstract = {Abstract Although many sources of atmospheric CO2 have been estimated, the major sinks are poorly understood in a deep‐time context. Here we combine plate reconstructions, the eruption ages and outlines of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), and the atmospheric CO2 proxy record to investigate how their eruptions and weathering within the equatorial humid zone impacted global atmospheric CO2 since 400 Ma. Wavelet analysis reveals significant correlations between the eruption of the Emeishan LIP (259 Ma), the Siberian Traps (251 Ma), the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (201 Ma), the second pulse of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (55 Ma), the High Arctic LIP (130 Ma), and the Deccan Traps (65 Ma) and perturbations in atmospheric CO2. Our analysis also reveals a clear relationship between the weathering of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (~200--100 Ma), the Deccan Traps (50--35 Ma), and the Afar Arabian LIP (30--0 Ma) and a significant atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Our results illustrate the significant role of subaerial LIP emplacement and weathering in modulating atmospheric CO2 and Earth's surface environments.},

@article{Krissansen-Totton2015a,
	Abstract = {Organic and inorganic carbon isotope records reflect the burial of organic carbon over geological timescales. Permanent burial of organic carbon in the crust or mantle oxidizes the surface environment (atmosphere, ocean and biosphere) by removing reduced carbon. It has been claimed that both organic and inorganic carbon isotope ratios have remained approximately constant throughout Earth's history, thereby implying that the flux of organic carbon burial relative to the total carbon input has remained fixed and cannot be invoked to explain the rise of atmospheric oxygen (Schidlowski, 1988; Catling and others, 2001; Holland, 2002; Holland, 2009; Kump and others, 2009; Rothman, 2015). However, the opposite conclusion has been drawn from the same carbon isotope record (Des Marais and others, 1992; Bjerrum and Canfield, 2004). To test these opposing claims, we compiled an updated carbon isotope database and applied both parametric and non-parametric statistical models to the data to quantify trends and mean-level changes in fractional organic carbon burial with associated uncertainties and confidence levels.We first consider a conventional mass-balance model where carbon input to surficial reservoirs is balanced by burial of sedimentary carbonates and organic carbon. For this model, statistical analysis implies fractional organic burial has increased over Earth history by a factor of 1.5 relative to organic burial at 3.6 Ga, with the 95 percent confidence interval ranging from factors of 1.2 to 2.0. An increase in organic burial by a factor of 1.2 cannot explain the rise of oxygen, whereas an increase by a factor of 2 could conceivably explain the rise of oxygen. There is, however, a highly significant and well constrained increase in organic burial from the Proterozoic to the Phanerozoic.We also analyze changes in the difference between carbonate and organic carbon isotopic ratios over Earth history. There is a statistically significant increase in this difference from the early to late Archean, possibly caused by increased biological fractionation due to methanotrophic recycling. This transition is consistent with the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis at 2.8 Ga or earlier.Finally, we explore how these conclusions change if we modify the traditional mass balance model to include other carbon cycle fluxes, specifically ocean crust carbonatization and authigenic carbonates. Because the size of these fluxes has a large, poorly constrained range, our statistical analysis with this uncertainty implies that the carbon isotope record does not constrain the history of organic burial at all. However, it remains possible that the magnitude of these additional processes has been inconsequential throughout geologic time, in which case conclusions from the conventional model would be valid.},

	Abstract = {This volume was conceived during EUROPROBE{\textquoteright}s investigations into the dynamic evolution of the Palaeozoic Uralide Orogen and relationships northwards into the Eurasian high Arctic. During these European Science Foundation studies, the preservation of Neoproterozoic deformation over large regions of northern Europe became increasingly apparent. This mainly Vendian tectonic event is referred to as the Timanian Orogeny and became the focus of many recent and on-going investigations. Much progress has been made in understanding Timanian Orogeny and a Memoir synthesizing our current knowledge is not only timely, but also relevant to Neoproterozoic global tectonic reconstructions. The type area for the Timanide Orogen is located in the Timan Range of northwestern Russia, which separates the East European Craton from the Pechora Basin and Polar Urals. The orogen extends over a distance of at least 3000 km, from the southern Ural Mountains of Kazakhstan to the Varanger Peninsula of northernmost Norway, flanking the eastern margin of the older craton (Fig. 1). From the Timan Range, it reaches northeastwards below the thick Phanerozoic successions of the Pechora Basin and Barents Shelf (O{\textquoteright}Leary et al. 2004), and reappears in the Polar Ural Mountains and northwards through Pai Khoi to Novaya Zemlya. Timanian orogeny thus influenced a vast region of northwestern Russia. The Phanerozoic cover, Arctic shelf areas and, further east, Uralian deformation, obscure the importance of this orogenic event for the geodynamic evolution of Europe. The Timanide Orogen has been referred to by various other names, most frequently as the {\textquoteleft}Baikalides{\textquoteright}. The term {\textquoteleft}Baikalian Orogeny{\textquoteright}},

@article{Pohl2014a,
	Abstract = {The Ordovician Period (485-443 Ma) is characterized by abundant evidence for continental-sized ice sheets. Modeling studies published so far require a sharp CO2 drawdown to initiate this glaciation. They mostly used non-dynamic slab mixed-layer ocean models. Here, we use a general circulation model with coupled components for ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice to examine the response of Ordovician climate to changes in CO2 and paleogeography. We conduct experiments for a wide range of CO2 (from 16 to 2 times the preindustrial atmospheric CO2 level (PAL)) and for two continental configurations (at 470 and at 450 Ma) mimicking the Middle and the Late Ordovician conditions. We find that the temperature-CO2 relationship is highly non-linear when ocean dynamics are taken into account. Two climatic modes are simulated as radiative forcing decreases. For high CO2 concentrations (≥12 PAL at 470 Ma and ≥8 PAL at 450 Ma), a relative hot climate with no sea ice characterizes the warm mode. When CO2 is decreased to 8 PAL and 6 PAL at 470 and 450 Ma, a tipping point is crossed and climate abruptly enters a runaway icehouse leading to a cold mode marked by the extension of the sea ice cover down to the mid-latitudes. At 450 Ma, the transition from the warm to the cold mode is reached for a decrease in atmospheric CO2 from 8 to 6 PAL and induces a \~{}9 $\,^{\circ}$C global cooling. We show that the tipping point is due to the existence of a 95{\%} oceanic Northern Hemisphere, which in turn induces a minimum in oceanic heat transport located around 40$\,^{\circ}$N. The latter allows sea ice to stabilize at these latitudes, explaining the potential existence of the warm and of the cold climatic modes. This major climatic instability potentially brings a new explanation to the sudden Late Ordovician Hirnantian glacial pulse that does not require any large CO2 drawdown.},

	Abstract = {Low‐latitude sea level glacial deposits suggest the existence of ``snowball Earth'' conditions in the Neoproterozoic. Previous modeling studies have offered conflicting support for the snowball hypothesis. We use a climate model of intermediate complexity, including an ocean GCM and a sophisticated thermodynamic/dynamic sea ice component, to conduct a suite of experiments with different orbital/paleogeographical configurations, wind‐forcing, and atmospheric CO2 levels. We show that depending on the orbital configuration and paleogeography, snowball conditions prevail even with atmospheric CO2 levels up to 1800 ppmv. Overall, our modeling paradigm is consistent with the original snowball hypothesis in which an ice covered ocean surrounds a largely snow and ice‐free barren land, with some coastal regions permitting the growth of thick glaciers.},

@article{North1983a,
	Abstract = {A one‐level seasonal energy balance climate model which has explicit two‐dimensional land‐sea geography is introduced and its properties analyzed. The model distinguishes land from sea surface strictly by the local thermal inertia employed. The transport is governed by a smooth latitude dependent diffusion mechanism. The model's seasonal cycle is solved for, with and without ice feedback. In each case, good agreement with real data is accomplished with minimal tuning of the adjustable parameters. The model sensitivity for small solar constant changes is in agreement with that of other accepted models. However, when the solar constant is lower a few percent, the ice cap grows discontinuously from covering Greenland and vicinity to a size three times larger and mostly into Northern Canada. A similar discontinuous growth occurs when the orbital elements are changed to favor cool summers in the Northern Hemisphere. This discontinuous sensitivity is discussed in the context of the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages, and the associated branch structure is shown to be analogous to the so called `small ice cap' instability known from simpler models. Although the discontinuity in sensitivity is some‐what conjectural, both linear and nonlinear models have their largest sensitivity to orbital parameter changes in the northern portions of the large continents; in the western hemisphere this also corresponds to the ice sheet boundary, suggesting that the land‐sea configuration is crucial to large glacier growth irrespective of moisture budgets. Other experiments and implications are also discussed.},

A compilation of the patterns of fossil and molecular diversification, comparative developmental data, and information on ecological feeding strategies indicate that the major animal clades diverged many tens of millions of years before their first appearance in the fossil record, demonstrating a macroevolutionary lag between the establishment of their developmental toolkits during the Cryogenian [(850 to 635 million years ago (Ma)], and the later ecological success of metazoans during the Ediacaran (635 to 541 Ma) and Cambrian (541 to 488 Ma) periods. We argue that this diversification involved new forms of developmental regulation, as well as innovations in networks of ecological interaction within the context of permissive environmental circumstances.},

@article{Swanson-Hysell2012a,
	Abstract = {The supercontinent Rodinia is hypothesized to have been assembled and positioned in tropical latitudes by the early Neoproterozoic Era. Paleomagnetic data from limestones of Svalbard and basaltic dikes of South China have been interpreted to record rapid changes in paleogeography driven by true polar wander that may have rotated the supercontinent in association with the ∼800 Ma Bitter Springs carbon isotope event. To further constrain early Neoproterozoic paleogeography and to test proposed rapid rotations, we have developed sequence- and chemo-stratigraphically constrained paleomagnetic data from the Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin of central Australia. A new paleomagnetic pole for the post-Bitter Springs stage ∼770 Ma Johnny's Creek Member (Bitter Springs Formation) provides a positive test for a long-lived history of Australia and Laurentia in a single supercontinent as its similar position to late Mesoproterozoic north Australia poles reproduces the closure of the Laurentian ``Grenville Loop.'' This new pole also provides support for the hypothesis that there was significant rotation between north and south+west Australia at the end of the Neoproterozoic as this rotation brings the south+west Australia ∼755 Ma Mundine Well pole into much closer proximity to the north Australia Johnny's Creek pole. Syn-Bitter Springs stage carbonates of the Love's Creek Member of the formation contain a well-behaved remanence held by magnetite. The direction of this remanent magnetization falls on the Cambrian portion of Australia's apparent polar wander path suggesting that the magnetite may have formed authigenically at that time. If primary, the Love's Creek direction is consistent with the true polar wander hypothesis for the Bitter Springs stage, is internally consistent with the relative sea level changes inferred from the formation, and can constrain Australia to a SouthWest North America East AnTarctica (SWEAT) fit. A remanence held by pyrrhotite in carbonates of the Bitter Springs Formation corresponds to the apparent polar wander path of Australia at ∼350 Ma. This component can be used to constrain the history of the Devonian-Carboniferous Alice Springs Orogeny as it demonstrates that regional folding of basinal sediments occurred prior to ∼350 Ma, but that the latest stages of tectonism in the hinterland drove fluids through the sediments that altered redox conditions to favor pyrrhotite precipitation.},

@article{Canfield2018a,
	Abstract = {Iron formations (IFs) are common before 1,800 million years ago (Ma) and again at \~{}750 Ma, but are remarkably absent for the billion years in between. We report on a 1,400-Ma IF of \~{}520 gigatons Fe from the Xiamaling Formation on the North China Craton. Biomarker analyses suggest that anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were involved in Fe(II) oxidation, and further geochemical analysis shows that IF sediments supported active microbial Fe reduction that rivaled oxic respiration in its efficiency of organic matter oxidation. The Xiamaling Formation IF demonstrates that geochemical conditions occasionally conspired to produce world-class IFs during Earth{\textquoteright}s {\textquotedblleft}middle ages,{\textquotedblright} permitting critical insights into the biogeochemical processes of IF emplacement.We describe a 1,400 million-year old (Ma) iron formation (IF) from the Xiamaling Formation of the North China Craton. We estimate this IF to have contained at least 520 gigatons of authigenic Fe, comparable in size to many IFs of the Paleoproterozoic Era (2,500{\textendash}1,600 Ma). Therefore, substantial IFs formed in the time window between 1,800 and 800 Ma, where they are generally believed to have been absent. The Xiamaling IF is of exceptionally low thermal maturity, allowing the preservation of organic biomarkers and an unprecedented view of iron-cycle dynamics during IF emplacement. We identify tetramethyl aryl isoprenoid (TMAI) biomarkers linked to anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and thus phototrophic Fe oxidation. Although we cannot rule out other pathways of Fe oxidation, iron and organic matter likely deposited to the sediment in a ratio similar to that expected for anoxygenic photosynthesis. Fe reduction was likely a dominant and efficient pathway of organic matter mineralization, as indicated by organic matter maturation by Rock Eval pyrolysis combined with carbon isotope analyses: Indeed, Fe reduction was seemingly as efficient as oxic respiration. Overall, this Mesoproterozoic-aged IF shows many similarities to Archean-aged (\&gt;2,500 Ma) banded IFs (BIFs), but with an exceptional state of preservation, allowing an unprecedented exploration of Fe-cycle dynamics in IF deposition.},

	Abstract = {Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic Era (2.5{\textendash}1.6 billion years ago). Increasing oxidation dramatically changed Earth{\textquoteright}s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of a two-billion-year-old and ~800 m-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by halite (~100 m) followed by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 m) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 m) dominated units. The evaporite minerals provide a robust constraint that marine sulfate concentrations were at least 10 mmol/kg, representing an oxidant reservoir equivalent to over 20\% of the modern ocean-atmosphere oxidizing capacity. These results show that substantial amounts of surface oxidant accumulated during this critical transition in Earth{\textquoteright}s oxygenation.},

@article{Harwood2011a,
	Abstract = {Abstract Ancient microbialites reflect interactions between microbial communities and environmental conditions. However, evaluating the relative roles of microbial community processes and environmental influences on microbialite morphology and internal fabric in the rock record can be challenging. The Neoproterozoic Beck Spring Dolomite preserves diverse microbialites, and thus provides an opportunity to explore the factors that influenced microbialite development locally. Stromatolitic, thrombolitic and composite microbialites are abundant in subtidal to upper intertidal carbonates in the Beck Spring Dolomite. Thrombolitic and composite microbialites have not been recognized previously in this unit, but compose much of the newly defined thrombolitic member. Stratigraphic relationships demonstrate that these three types of microbialites formed in close spatial and temporal association in subtidal to intertidal environments. The relative proportions and distributions of stromatolitic and thrombolitic microbialites vary with depositional environment; stromatolitic microbialites dominate in deeper intertidal to subtidal facies, whereas thrombolitic textures are more abundant in upper intertidal facies. Composite microbialites, composed of intermingled clotted and laminated textures, formed in all environments but are most abundant in intertidal facies. The broad environmental distribution of stromatolitic, thrombolitic and composite microbialites and the intermingling of textures suggest that laminated and clotted textures reflect diverse microbial community morphologies rather than environmental variations. Furthermore, the ca 750 Ma age of thrombolitic microbialites in the Beck Spring Dolomite requires that they formed without the influence of calcimicrobes or metazoans colonizing and grazing the microbial mat surface. Thus, these thrombolites provide further evidence that the biostratigraphic distribution of thrombolites cannot be uniquely attributed to evolution of calcifying and grazing organisms in the earliest Cambrian, and that older microbial communities were capable of producing clotted textures.},

	Abstract = {The Beck Spring Dolomite is a mixed carbonate{\textendash}siliciclastic succession exposed in Death Valley, California, that was deposited between 780 and 717 Ma. Along with its bounding units, the Horse Thief Springs Formation below and unit KP1 of the Kingston Peak Formation above, the Beck Spring Dolomite were deposited in one of the ChUMP (Chuar{\textendash}Uinta Mountains{\textendash}Pahrump) basins with subsidence commonly attributed to the nascent rifting of Rodinia. These pre-Sturtian successions preserve eukaryotic microfossil assemblages, diverse microbialites, and large carbon isotope anomalies directly below Sturtian-age glacial deposits. Here we present new geological mapping, measured stratigraphic sections, carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and detrital zircon geochronology from the Beck Spring Dolomite and its bounding units. The carbon isotope excursion at the top of the Beck Spring Dolomite has previously been attributed to meteoric diagenesis associated with karst breccias, but here we demonstrate that these breccias are instead mass flow deposits that formed during deposition of the Kingston Peak Formation and that the carbon isotope excursion is not only reproducible throughout the basin, but is associated with transgression rather than regression and exposure. In addition, we refine local correlations and discuss the use of chemostratigraphic curves from these units for regional and global correlations. The Beck Spring Dolomite was deposited during the second of three distinct basin-forming events recorded in the Pahrump Group with basin inversion occurring between each event. The presence of syn-sedimentary faults, the character of the lateral facies change and detrital zircon provenance analyses indicate that the Beck Spring Dolomite fringed a coeval palaeo-high to the south in a tectonically active basin. Detrital zircon age distributions in the Beck Spring Dolomite show sharp probability peaks at c. 1200, 1400 and 1800 Ma, consistent with local sources to the SW in the Mojave block rather than transcontinental rivers. The c. 1800 Ma probability peak is less prominent in the KP1 samples. In addition, KP1 also records slump folding and is overlain by an unconformity. We suggest that these features are consistent with the emergence of a local fault to the NE. Deposition of the Beck Spring Dolomite and bounding units do not record evidence of incipient rifting of the western margin of Laurentia but instead reflect a distinct and separate tectonothermal event.Supplementary material: Carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopic measurements, detrital zircon laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) data, detrital zircon sample information and data from reference materials used for LA-ICPMS analyses are available at http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18823.},

	Abstract = {Since 65 million years ago (Ma), Earth{\textquoteright}s climate has undergone a significant and complex evolution, the finer details of which are now coming to light through investigations of deep-sea sediment cores. This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 105to 107 years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 104- to 106-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 103 to 105 years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.},

	Abstract = { All life on Earth is dependent on biologically mediated electron transfer (i.e., redox) reactions that are far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Biological redox reactions originally evolved in prokaryotes and ultimately, over the first ∼2.5 billion years of Earth's history, formed a global electronic circuit. To maintain the circuit on a global scale requires that oxidants and reductants be transported; the two major planetary wires that connect global metabolism are geophysical fluids-the atmosphere and the oceans. Because all organisms exchange gases with the environment, the evolution of redox reactions has been a major force in modifying the chemistry at Earth's surface. Here we briefly review the discovery and consequences of redox reactions in microbes with a specific focus on the coevolution of life and geochemical phenomena. },

	Abstract = {Past {\textquotedblleft}Oceanic Anoxic Events{\textquotedblright} (OAEs) represent important carbon cycle perturbations that offer the opportunity to study Earth{\textquoteright}s response to extreme climate warming. A fundamental limitation for understanding OAEs is quantifying the timing and total extent of ocean anoxia. We present a quantitative account of global redox conditions for OAE 2 (\~{}94 million years ago), using a high-resolution record of uranium isotopes combined with a biogeochemical model. We present new evidence for two discrete intervals of globally extensive anoxia that were coupled to enhanced terrestrial weathering, within the typically defined OAE interval. These anoxic intervals were separated by ocean reoxygenation and the temporary recovery of the carbon cycle.Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2), occurring \~{}94 million years ago, was one of the most extreme carbon cycle and climatic perturbations of the Phanerozoic Eon. It was typified by a rapid rise in atmospheric CO2, global warming, and marine anoxia, leading to the widespread devastation of marine ecosystems. However, the precise timing and extent to which oceanic anoxic conditions expanded during OAE 2 remains unresolved. We present a record of global ocean redox changes during OAE 2 using a combined geochemical and carbon cycle modeling approach. We utilize a continuous, high-resolution record of uranium isotopes in pelagic and platform carbonate sediments to quantify the global extent of seafloor anoxia during OAE 2. This dataset is then compared with a dynamic model of the coupled global carbon, phosphorus, and uranium cycles to test hypotheses for OAE 2 initiation. This unique approach highlights an intra-OAE complexity that has previously been underconstrained, characterized by two expansions of anoxia separated by an episode of globally significant reoxygenation coincident with the {\textquotedblleft}Plenus Cold Event.{\textquotedblright} Each anoxic expansion event was likely driven by rapid atmospheric CO2 injections from multiphase Large Igneous Province activity.},

@article{Berhe1990a,
	Abstract = {The presence of ophiolite complexes in NE and E Africa has been documented using Landsat, field and geochemical studies. The present work identifies five major ophiolitic sutures in NE Africa, while plate reconstruction of Africa and Madagascar suggests a possible sixth ophiolite belt to the east. The ophiolites are considered to be remnants of supra-subduction zones and back-arc basins. The ophiolites are dismembered, and their mode of occurrence varies widely resulting in different structural relationships. In Western Ethiopia, the Yubdo complex is formed of harzburgite which grades into a cumulate sequence of ultramafic and gabbroic rocks and metabasalts. In Kenya, the Baragoi complex is formed of tectonized harzburgite with dunite and chromite pods, a cumulate sequence of ultramafic and gabbroic units and a dyke unit. Trace element data from the Baragoi complex show a transitional mid-ocean ridge basaltic to island arc tholeiitic affinity, and the presence of boninites suggests a supra-subduction setting, while data from the Adola-Moyale belt (S. Ethiopia-NE Kenya) indicate an island-arc and MORB geochemistry, which developed in a back-arc tectonic setting. In Sudan, the Ingessana complex which has an island arc tholeiitic tectonic affinity indicates development in a supra-subduction setting, while the trace element suggest that the Sol Hamed complex developed in a back-arc basin.These ophiolite belts represent sutures marking the position of island arcs extending to those in Saudi Arabia on a pre-Red Sea drift reconstruction and further south to Mozambique. The terrane delimited by a proposed Ingessana-Port Sudan suture and by the Adola-Moyale ophiolite belts as defined in this study encompasses an area in which the crust was derived from oceanic and island arc material. Relative age reconstruction across the Arabian-Nubian Shield in East Africa broadly indicates eastward younging of the ophiolite belts. Regional geological, tectonic and geochemical studies suggest rifting at c. 1200 Ma and subsequent convergence led to the development of intra-oceanic arcs and associated marginal basins in the north and narrow basins within the sialic basement gneisses further south in Kenya and Tanzania. This was followed by continent-continent collision which led to accretion of island arcs by gentle collision from the northeast in Saudi Arabia and severe crustal shortening in S Sudan, Kenya and SE Ethiopia as compared to Saudi Arabia, NE Sudan and N and W Ethiopia owing to oblique collision from the southeast.},

@article{Olson2015a,
	Abstract = {We use polarity reversal systematics from numerical dynamos to quantify the hypothesis that the modulation of geomagnetic reversal frequency, including geomagnetic superchrons, results from changes in core heat flux related to growth and collapse of lower mantle superplumes. We parameterize the reversal frequency sensitivity from numerical dynamos in terms of average core heat flux normalized by the difference between the present-day core heat flux and the core heat flux at geomagnetic superchron onset. A low-order polynomial fit to the 0-300 Ma Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) reveals that a decrease in core heat flux relative to present-day of approximately 30% can account for the Cretaceous Normal Polarity and Kiaman Reverse Polarity Superchrons, whereas the hyper-reversing periods in the Jurassic require a core heat flux equal to or higher than present-day. Possible links between GPTS transitions, large igneous provinces (LIPs), and the two lower mantle superplumes are explored. Lower mantle superplume growth and collapse induce GPTS transitions by increasing and decreasing core heat flux, respectively. Age clusters of major LIPs postdate transitions from hyper-reversing to superchron geodynamo states by 30-60 Myr, suggesting that superchron onset may be contemporaneous with LIP-forming instabilities produced during collapses of lower mantle superplumes.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) data for the last 420 million years (My) show long-term fluctuations related to supercontinent cycles as well as shorter cycles at 26 to 32 My whose origin is unknown. Periodicities of 26 to 30 My occur in diverse geological phenomena including mass extinctions, flood basalt volcanism, ocean anoxic events, deposition of massive evaporites, sequence boundaries, and orogenic events and have previously been linked to an extraterrestrial mechanism. The vast oceanic crustal carbon reservoir is an alternative potential driving force of climate fluctuations at these time scales, with hydrothermal crustal carbon uptake occurring mostly in young crust with a strong dependence on ocean bottom water temperature. We combine a global plate model and oceanic paleo-age grids with estimates of paleo-ocean bottom water temperatures to track the evolution of the oceanic crustal carbon reservoir over the past 230 My. We show that seafloor spreading rates as well as the storage, subduction, and emission of oceanic crustal and mantle CO2 fluctuate with a period of 26 My. A connection with seafloor spreading rates and equivalent cycles in subduction zone rollback suggests that these periodicities are driven by the dynamics of subduction zone migration. The oceanic crust-mantle carbon cycle is thus a previously overlooked mechanism that connects plate tectonic pulsing with fluctuations in atmospheric carbon and surface environments.},

@article{Wolbach2018a,
	Abstract = { AbstractPart 1 of this study investigated evidence of biomass burning in global ice records, and here we continue to test the hypothesis that an impact event at the Younger Dryas boundary (YDB) caused an anomalously intense episode of biomass burning at ∼12.8 ka on a multicontinental scale (North and South America, Europe, and Asia). Quantitative analyses of charcoal and soot records from 152 lakes, marine cores, and terrestrial sequences reveal a major peak in biomass burning at the Younger Dryas (YD) onset that appears to be the highest during the latest Quaternary. For the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (K-Pg) impact event, concentrations of soot were previously utilized to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, and similar measurements suggest that wildfires at the YD onset rapidly consumed ∼10 million km2 of Earth's surface, or ∼9\% of Earth's biomass, considerably more than for the K-Pg impact. Bayesian analyses and age regressions demonstrate that ages for YDB peaks in charcoal and soot across four continents are synchronous with the ages of an abundance peak in platinum in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core and of the YDB impact event (12,835-12,735 cal BP). Thus, existing evidence indicates that the YDB impact event caused an anomalously large episode of biomass burning, resulting in extensive atmospheric soot/dust loading that triggered an ``impact winter.'' This, in turn, triggered abrupt YD cooling and other climate changes, reinforced by climatic feedback mechanisms, including Arctic sea ice expansion, rerouting of North American continental runoff, and subsequent ocean circulation changes. },

The primary origin for the characteristic remanent magnetizations is supported by a positive baked contact test, a dyke-tilt test and rock magnetic data. After tilt corrections, 10 dykes from the c. 824 Ma group gave a mean remanent direction of D=230.1{\textdegree}, I=-72.6{\textdegree} with k=16.3 and α95=12.3{\textdegree}, corresponding to a palaeopole at 42.5 {\textdegree}N, 131.8 {\textdegree}E with A95=19.0{\textdegree}. Three dykes from the c. 806 Ma group give a mean direction of D=284.5{\textdegree}, I=42.6{\textdegree} with k=76.5 and α95=14.2, corresponding to a virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) at 18.2 {\textdegree}N, 31.0 {\textdegree}E with A95=20.4{\textdegree}. After correcting for a 5{\textdegree} vertical-axis rotation of the study region, the two pole positions are at 45.1 {\textdegree}N, 130.4 {\textdegree}E and 14.1 {\textdegree}N, 32.5 {\textdegree}E, respectively.

	Abstract = {Reconstructing the degree of warming during geological periods of elevated CO2 provides a way of testing our understanding of the Earth system and the accuracy of climate models. We present accurate estimates of tropical sea-surface temperatures (SST) and seawater chemistry during the Eocene (56{\textendash}34 Ma before present, CO2 \&gt;560 ppm). This latter dataset enables us to reinterpret a large amount of existing proxy data. We find that tropical SST are characterized by a modest warming in response to CO2. Coupling these data to a conservative estimate of high-latitude warming demonstrates that most climate simulations do not capture the degree of Eocene polar amplification.Past greenhouse periods with elevated atmospheric CO2 were characterized by globally warmer sea-surface temperatures (SST). However, the extent to which the high latitudes warmed to a greater degree than the tropics (polar amplification) remains poorly constrained, in particular because there are only a few temperature reconstructions from the tropics. Consequently, the relationship between increased CO2, the degree of tropical warming, and the resulting latitudinal SST gradient is not well known. Here, we present coupled clumped isotope (Δ47)-Mg/Ca measurements of foraminifera from a set of globally distributed sites in the tropics and midlatitudes. Δ47 is insensitive to seawater chemistry and therefore provides a robust constraint on tropical SST. Crucially, coupling these data with Mg/Ca measurements allows the precise reconstruction of Mg/Casw throughout the Eocene, enabling the reinterpretation of all planktonic foraminifera Mg/Ca data. The combined dataset constrains the range in Eocene tropical SST to 30{\textendash}36 {\textdegree}C (from sites in all basins). We compare these accurate tropical SST to deep-ocean temperatures, serving as a minimum constraint on high-latitude SST. This results in a robust conservative reconstruction of the early Eocene latitudinal gradient, which was reduced by at least 32 {\textpm} 10\% compared with present day, demonstrating greater polar amplification than captured by most climate models.},

@article{Edwards2017a,
	Abstract = {The largest radiation of Phanerozoic marine animal life quadrupled genus-level diversity towards the end of the Ordovician Period about 450 million years ago. A leading hypothesis for this Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event is that cooling of the Ordovician climate lowered sea surface temperatures into the thermal tolerance window of many animal groups, such as corals. A complementary role for oxygenation of subsurface environments has been inferred based on the increasing abundance of skeletal carbonate, but direct constraints on atmospheric O2 levels remain elusive. Here, we use high-resolution paired bulk carbonate and organic carbon isotope records to determine the changes in isotopic fractionation between these phases throughout the Ordovician radiation. These results can be used to reconstruct atmospheric O2 levels based on the O2-dependent fractionation of carbon isotopes by photosynthesis. We find a strong temporal link between the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event and rising O2 concentrations, a pattern that is corroborated by O2 models that use traditional carbon-sulfur mass balance. We conclude that that oxygen levels probably played an important role in regulating early Palaeozoic biodiversity levels, even after the Cambrian Explosion.},

	Abstract = {The geological record of protists begins well before the Ediacaran and Cambrian diversification of animals, but the antiquity of that history, its reliability as a chronicle of evolution and the causal inferences that can be drawn from it remain subjects of debate. Well-preserved protists are known from a relatively small number of Proterozoic formations, but taphonomic considerations suggest that they capture at least broad aspects of early eukaryotic evolution. A modest diversity of problematic, possibly stem group protists occurs in ca 1800{\textendash}1300 Myr old rocks. 1300{\textendash}720 Myr fossils document the divergence of major eukaryotic clades, but only with the Ediacaran{\textendash}Cambrian radiation of animals did diversity increase within most clades with fossilizable members. While taxonomic placement of many Proterozoic eukaryotes may be arguable, the presence of characters used for that placement is not. Focus on character evolution permits inferences about the innovations in cell biology and development that underpin the taxonomic and morphological diversification of eukaryotic organisms.},

@article{Hoffman2017a,
	Abstract = {Geological evidence indicates that grounded ice sheets reached sea level at all latitudes during two long-lived Cryogenian (58 and >=5 My) glaciations. Combined uranium-lead and rhenium-osmium dating suggests that the older (Sturtian) glacial onset and both terminations were globally synchronous. Geochemical data imply that CO2 was 102 PAL (present atmospheric level) at the younger termination, consistent with a global ice cover. Sturtian glaciation followed breakup of a tropical supercontinent, and its onset coincided with the equatorial emplacement of a large igneous province. Modeling shows that the small thermal inertia of a globally frozen surface reverses the annual mean tropical atmospheric circulation, producing an equatorial desert and net snow and frost accumulation elsewhere. Oceanic ice thickens, forming a sea glacier that flows gravitationally toward the equator, sustained by the hydrologic cycle and by basal freezing and melting. Tropical ice sheets flow faster as CO2 rises but lose mass and become sensitive to orbital changes. Equatorial dust accumulation engenders supraglacial oligotrophic meltwater ecosystems, favorable for cyanobacteria and certain eukaryotes. Meltwater flushing through cracks enables organic burial and submarine deposition of airborne volcanic ash. The subglacial ocean is turbulent and well mixed, in response to geothermal heating and heat loss through the ice cover, increasing with latitude. Terminal carbonate deposits, unique to Cryogenian glaciations, are products of intense weathering and ocean stratification. Whole-ocean warming and collapsing peripheral bulges allow marine coastal flooding to continue long after ice-sheet disappearance. The evolutionary legacy of Snowball Earth is perceptible in fossils and living organisms.},

	Abstract = {A compilation of nearly 25,000 rates of sediment accumulation shows that they are extremely variable, spanning at least 11 orders of magnitude. Much of this variation results from compiling rates determined for different time spans: there is a systematic trend of falling mean rate with increasing time span. The gradients of such trends vary with environment of deposition. Although measurement error and compaction contribute to these regressions, they are primarily the consequence of unsteady, discontinuous sedimentation. The essential character of the unsteadiness may be cyclic or random, but net accumulation is characterized by fluctuations whose magnitudes increase with increasing recurrence interval. Ratios of median long- to short-term accumulation rates provide a measure of the expected completeness of sedimentary stratigraphic sections, at the time scale of the short-term rate. Expected completeness deteriorates as finer time scales are considered.},

@article{Schrag2002a,
	Abstract = {The Snowball Earth hypothesis explains the development of glaciation at low latitudes in the Neoproterozoic, as well as the associated iron formations and cap carbonates, in terms of a runaway ice-albedo feedback leading to a global glaciation followed by an extreme greenhouse climate. The initiation of a snowball glaciation is linked to a variety of unusual perturbations of the carbon cycle operating over different timescales, as evidenced by unusual patterns in the carbon isotopic composition of marine carbonate. Thus a theory for why multiple glaciations happened at this time, and not in the Phanerozoic nor earlier in the Proterozoic, requires a reexamination of the carbon cycle and the controls on climate stability. We propose that the concentration of continental area in the tropics was a critical boundary condition necessary for the onset of glaciation, both because the existence of substantial continental area at high latitudes may prevent atmospheric carbon dioxide from getting too low and because a tropical concentration of continental area may lead to more efficient burial of organic carbon through increased tropical river discharge. Efficient organic carbon burial sustained over tens of millions of years, required by the high carbon isotopic compositions of preglacial carbonate, may lead to the buildup of enormous quantities of methane, presumably in hydrate reservoirs. We examine how the slow release of this methane may explain the drop in δ13C values immediately before the glaciation. Moreover, the accumulation of methane in the atmosphere coupled with the response of silicate weathering to the additional greenhouse forcing can lead to a climate with methane as the major greenhouse gas. This situation is unstable because methane is not buffered by a large ocean reservoir like carbon dioxide, and so the collapse of the methane source may provide a trigger for the onset of a runaway ice-albedo feedback. A simple model of the carbon cycle is used to explore the boundary conditions that would allow this to occur.},

@article{Bernard2017a,
	Abstract = {Oxygen-isotope compositions of fossilised planktonic and benthic foraminifera tests are used as proxies for surface- and deep-ocean paleotemperatures, providing a continuous benthic record for the past 115 Ma. However, visually imperceptible processes can alter these proxies during sediment burial. Here, we investigate the diffusion-controlled re-equilibration process with experiments exposing foraminifera tests to elevated pressures and temperatures in isotopically heavy artificial seawater (H2                        18O), followed by scanning electron microscopy and quantitative NanoSIMS imaging: oxygen-isotope compositions changed heterogeneously at submicrometer length scales without any observable modifications of the test ultrastructures. In parallel, numerical modelling of diffusion during burial shows that oxygen-isotope re-equilibration of fossil foraminifera tests can cause significant overestimations of ocean paleotemperatures on a time scale of 107 years under natural conditions. Our results suggest that the late Cretaceous and Paleogene deep-ocean and high-latitude surface-ocean temperatures were significantly lower than is generally accepted, thereby explaining the paradox of the low equator-to-pole surface-ocean thermal gradient inferred for these periods.},

@inbook{Van-der-Voo2015a,
	Abstract = {The Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean closed when the Amuria block, normally considered to have been part of the North China block since the early Mesozoic, and the southern margin of Siberia collided in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times. The resulting suture runs WSW-ENE and is reasonably well defined to the east of longitude 100$\,^{\circ}$E. Because no evidence exists for any westward prolongation of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean suture toward the Tarim block, the cryptic termination of the suture is an enigma, compounded by the fact that a tomographically identified slab in the lower 1000 km of the mantle, interpreted as a remnant of Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic lithosphere, has a clear N-S trend, at almost right angles to the surface suture. No sensible explanation can be constructed for a rotation of some 90$\,^{\circ}$of this slab. There is a solution, however, to both these enigmas if we consider that the Triassic Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean existed east of an initially meridian-parallel, but later progressively more sinuous, late Paleozoic Pangea margin. This margin consisted of Siberia, Amuria, and the China continental elements. The Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean was subducting westward during the early Mesozoic and likely older times underneath this margin. This would readily explain the tomographic N-S slab orientation at depths of 2000 km and greater. Paleomagnetic inclination differences between the global apparent polar wander path in Siberian coordinates and results from the North China block show a gradually diminishing trend with time, as these cratons approached each other during the Jurassic. During this time, the paleomagnetic data of the North China block show that it underwent a slight northward motion, but with a considerable counterclockwise rotation of ∼90$\,^{\circ}$. At the same time, the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean-bordering margin of Eurasia (between Siberia and Tarim) moved southward by ∼30$\,^{\circ}$and rotated 45$\,^{\circ}$clockwise. These continental scissoring movements caused doubly vergent subduction of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean. Paleomagnetic data suggest final closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean in latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous time. Arc-related rocks above the subduction zone follow the outline around the core of the Tuva-Mongol belt in the eastern Altaids between Amuria and Siberia, and they form a tightening, westward-convex Tuva-Mongol orocline. This large-scale oroclinal bending of the crust above a disappearing ocean is reminiscent of similarly tightening oroclines in Kazakhstan and Variscan Europe, which closed earlier by subduction in the late Paleozoic.},

@article{Greber2017a,
	Abstract = {The composition of continental crust far back in Earth{\textquoteright}s history gives us insight into when plate tectonics ramped up and has influenced ocean chemistry. Greber et al. looked at titanium isotopes in shales, which form from eroded continental crustal sediments, to estimate the composition 3.5 billion years ago, closer to the origins of Earth. They found a silica-rich composition, which indicates that plate tectonics was happening deep in our distant past. Other changes in crustal composition might be linked to changing ocean chemistry and major events such as the oxygenation of our atmosphere.Science, this issue p. 1271Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.},

@article{Raiswell2012a,
	Abstract = {Presented here is a combined historical account, current synthesis and a perspective of how the modern Fe cycle functions, and how this cycle has evolved through geologic time. We begin by highlighting how new developments in nanogeoscience demonstrate the importance of nanoparticulate Fe (oxyhydr) oxide aggregates in the modern iron cycle. We further document how these aggregates are supplied from shelf sediments, aeolian dust and icebergs to the global ocean. Based on these observations, we present a kinetic model evaluating the supply of bioavailable Fe to surface seawater by ferrihydrite dissolution, photoreduction and siderophore-aided dissolution. The model indicates that the rate of delivery of bioavailable Fe from icebergs to the Southern Ocean is at least as large as that by wind-blown dust. However estimates of all the main aqueous, nanoparticulate and colloidal (and potentially bioavailable) Fe inputs to the ocean are poorly-constrained. We provide a historical perspective on the evolution of ideas as to how sedimentary pyrite formation is controlled and how these ideas led to the development of the Fe-based palaeoenvironmental proxies widely used today. This provides a springboard into our discussion of the ancient Fe cycle, which begins with a survey of how Fe interacts with a variety of other elements of biogeochemical interest including sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen. We highlight how interactions between these elements have evolved through geologic time, and how these interactions define the evolution of ocean and atmospheric chemistry. It is clear that the Fe cycle has gained a prominent role in regulating the biogeochemical function of the oceans through time. We offer, in the end, suggestions and a geochemical perspective as to how recent momentum in our understanding of the Fe cycle may be harnessed into catalysing future progress in the field.},

	Abstract = {Anomalous peaks of nickel abundance have been reported in Permian-Triassic boundary sections in China, Israel, Eastern Europe, Spitzbergen, and the Austrian Carnic Alps. New solution ICP-MS results of enhanced nickel from P-T boundary sections in Hungary, Japan, and Spiti, India suggest that the nickel anomalies at the end of the Permian were a worldwide phenomenon. We propose that the source of the nickel anomalies at the P-T boundary were Ni-rich volatiles released by the Siberian volcanism, and by coeval Ni-rich magma intrusions. The peaks in nickel abundance correlate with negative δ13C and δ18O anomalies, suggesting that explosive reactions between magma and coal during the Siberian flood-basalt eruptions released large amounts of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere, causing severe global warming and subsequent mass extinction. The nickel anomalies may provide a timeline in P-T boundary sections, and the timing of the peaks supports the Siberian Traps as a contributor to the latest Permian mass extinction.},

	Abstract = {An enigmatic stepwise increase in oxygen in the late Precambrian is widely considered a prerequisite for the expansion of animal life. Accumulation of oxygen requires organic matter burial in sediments, which is largely controlled by the sheltering or preservational effects of detrital clay minerals in modern marine continental margin depocenters. Here, we show mineralogical and geochemical evidence for an increase in clay mineral deposition in the Neoproterozoic that immediately predated the first metazoans. Today most clay minerals originate in biologically active soils, so initial expansion of a primitive land biota would greatly enhance production of pedogenic clay minerals (the {\textquotedblleft}clay mineral factory{\textquotedblright}), leading to increased marine burial of organic carbon via mineral surface preservation.},

However, the time when colonization occurred remains speculative. The first fossil land plants and fungi appeared 480 to 460 million years ago (Ma), whereas molecular clock estimates suggest an earlier colonization of land, about 600 Ma. Our protein sequence analyses indicate that green algae and major lineages of fungi were present 1000 Ma and that land plants appeared by 700 Ma, possibly affecting Earth{\textquoteright}s atmosphere, climate, and evolution of animals in the Precambrian.},

Recent documentation of palaeosols in the Ediacara Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite of South Australia\^{}sup 4\^{} confirms past interpretations of lagoonal-aeolian deposition based on synsedimentary ferruginization and loessic texture\^{}sup 5,6\^{}. Further evidence for palaeosols comes from non-marine facies, dilation cracks, soil nodules, sand crystals, stable isotopic data and mass balance geochemistry\^{}sup 4\^{}. Here I show that the uppermost surfaces of the palaeosols have a variety of fossils in growth position, including Charniodiscus, Dickinsonia, Hallidaya, Parvancorina, Phyllozoon, Praecambridium, Rugoconites, Tribrachidium and 'old-elephant skin' (ichnogenus Rivularites\^{}sup 7\^{}). These fossils were preserved as ferruginous impressions, like plant fossils\^{}sup 8\^{}, and biological soil crusts\^{}sup 9,10\^{} of Phanerozoic eon sandy palaeosols. Sand crystals after gypsum\^{}sup 11\^{} and nodules of carbonate\^{}sup 12\^{} are shallow within the palaeosols\^{}sup 4\^{}, even after correcting for burial compaction\^{}sup 13\^{}. Periglacial involutions and modest geochemical differentiation of the palaeosols are evidence of a dry, cold temperate Ediacaran palaeoclimate in South Australia\^{}sup 4\^{}. This new interpretation of some Ediacaran fossils as large sessile organisms of cool, dry soils, is compatible with observations that Ediacaran fossils were similar in appearance and preservation to lichens and other microbial colonies of biological soil crusts\^{}sup 3\^{}, rather than marine animals\^{}sup 1\^{}, or protists\^{}sup 2\^{}. {$[$}PUBLICATION ABSTRACT{$]$}},

@article{Knauth2009a,
	Abstract = {Many aspects of the carbon cycle can be assessed from temporal changes in the \^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C ratio of oceanic bicarbonate. \^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C can temporarily rise when large amounts of \^{}sup 13\^{}C-depleted photosynthetic organic matter are buried at enhanced rates, and can decrease if phytomass is rapidly oxidized or if low \^{}sup 13\^{}C is rapidly released from methane clathrates. Assuming that variations of the marine \^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C ratio are directly recorded in carbonate rocks, thousands of carbon isotope analyses of late Precambrian examples have been published to correlate these otherwise undatable strata and to document perturbations to the carbon cycle just before the great expansion of metazoan life. Low \^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C in some Neoproterozoic carbonates is considered evidence of carbon cycle perturbations unique to the Precambrian. These include complete oxidation of all organic matter in the ocean and complete productivity collapse such that low-\^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C hydrothermal CO2 becomes the main input of carbon. Here we compile all published oxygen and carbon isotope data for Neoproterozoic marine carbonates, and consider them in terms of processes known to alter the isotopic composition during transformation of the initial precipitate into limestone/dolostone. We show that the combined oxygen and carbon isotope systematics are identical to those of well-understood Phanerozoic examples that lithified in coastal pore fluids, receiving a large groundwater influx of photosynthetic carbon from terrestrial phytomass. Rather than being perturbations to the carbon cycle, widely reported decreases in \^{}sup 13\^{}C/\^{}sup 12\^{}C in Neoproterozoic carbonates are more easily interpreted in the same way as is done for Phanerozoic examples. This influx of terrestrial carbon is not apparent in carbonates older than \~{}850 Myr, so we infer an explosion of photosynthesizing communities on late Precambrian land surfaces. As a result, biotically enhanced weathering generated carbon-bearing soils on a large scale and their detrital sedimentation sequestered carbon. This facilitated a rise in O2 necessary for the expansion of multicellular life. {$[$}PUBLICATION ABSTRACT{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Biomineralization marks one of the most significant evolutionary milestones among the Eukarya, but its roots in the fossil record remain obscure. We report crystallographic and geochemical evidence for controlled eukaryotic biomineralization in Neoproterozoic scale microfossils from the Fifteenmile Group of Yukon, Canada. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that the microfossils are constructed of a hierarchically organized interwoven network of fibrous hydroxyapatite crystals each elongated along the [001] direction, indicating biological control over microstructural crystallization. New Re-Os geochronological data from organic-rich shale directly below the fossil-bearing limestone constrain their age to \&lt;810.7 {\textpm} 6.3 million years ago. Mineralogical and geochemical variations from these sedimentary rocks indicate that dynamic global marine redox conditions, enhanced by local restriction, may have led to an increase in dissolved phosphate in pore and bottom waters of the Fifteenmile basin and facilitated the necessary geochemical conditions for the advent of calcium phosphate biomineralization.},

	Abstract = {The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) was characterized by a major disturbance to the global carbon(C)-cycle, and depleted oxygen in Earth's oceans resulting in marine mass extinction. Numerical models predict that increased organic carbon burial should drive a rise in atmospheric oxygen (pO(2)) leading to termination of an OAE after ∼1 Myr. Wildfire is highly responsive to changes in pO(2) implying that fire-activity should vary across OAEs. Here we test this hypothesis by tracing variations in the abundance of fossil charcoal across the T-OAE. We report a sustained ∼800 kyr enhancement of fire-activity beginning ∼1 Myr after the onset of the T-OAE and peaking during its termination. This major enhancement of fire occurred across the timescale of predicted pO(2) variations, and we argue this was primarily driven by increased pO(2). Our study provides the first fossil-based evidence suggesting that fire-feedbacks to rising pO(2) may have aided in terminating the T-OAE.},

	Abstract = {The carbon isotopic (δ13C) composition of bulk carbonate sediments deposited off the margins of four carbonate platforms/ramp systems (Bahamas, Maldives, Queensland Plateau, and Great Australian Bight) show synchronous changes over the past 0 to 10 million years. However, these variations are different from the established global pattern in the δ13C measured in the open oceans over the same time period. For example, from 10 Ma to the present, the δ13C of open oceanic carbonate has decreased, whereas platform margin sediments analyzed here show an increase. It is suggested that the δ13C patterns in the marginal platform deposits are produced through admixing of aragonite-rich sediments, which have relatively positive δ13C values, with pelagic materials, which have lower δ13C values. As the more isotopically positive shallow-water carbonate sediments are only produced when the platforms are flooded, there is a connection between changes in global sea level and the δ13C of sediments in marginal settings. These data indicate that globally synchronous changes in δ13C can take place that are completely unrelated to variations in the global carbon cycle. Fluctuations in the δ13C of carbonate sediments measured during previous geological periods may also be subject to similar processes, and global synchroniety of δ13C can no longer necessarily be considered an indicator that such changes are related to, or caused by, variations in the burial of organic carbon. Inferences regarding the interpretation of changes in the cycling of organic carbon derived from δ13C records should be reconsidered in light of the findings presented here.},

@article{Pollock2006a,
	Abstract = {Molar-tooth (MT) is an enigmatic carbonate fabric composed of variously shaped cracks and voids filled with a characteristically uniform, equant microspar. MT is both abundant and widespread in Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic strata, where void-filling microspar comprises up to 90% of individual beds and 5-25% of preserved carbonate. The temporal restriction of this fabric suggests a potential link between MT formation and the biogeochemical evolution of marine environments. Detailed petrographic relationships among MT crack morphology, distribution of MT microspar, and composition of the surrounding substrate suggest that crack formation and microspar precipitation are intimately linked to the decomposition of sedimentary organic matter in the presence of supersaturated Proterozoic seawater.Laboratory experiments have shown that gas generated within unconsolidated mud can reproduce a variety of MT crack morphologies, yet current gas expansion and migration models do not explicitly consider the role of substrate variability in determining morphologies of MT cracks. A detailed petrographic examination of MT structures from the Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup, Montana, permits interpretation of the microscale relationship between crack morphology and lithologic, and potentially rheologic, variability of the surrounding substrate by tracing the distribution of petrographically distinctive MT microspar. Observations of lateral offset of MT cracks at bedding planes or within coarser-grained siltstone or sandstone layers, termination of cracks beneath clay- or organic-rich horizons, grain collapse into underlying MT cracks, and the presence of MT microspar as a pore-filling precipitate suggest that grain size, substrate lithology, and substrate cohesion all play critical roles in the development of MT cracks. By contrast, the presence of a wide range of MT crack morphologies within petrographically homogeneous substrates, and an apparent relationship between crack diameter and sinuosity, suggest that the void-forming process itself also played a role in determining the final morphology of MT cracks. Together, these petrographic observations are used to define a model of microscale gas-sediment interactions that can be used to interpret crack morphology in terms of gas pressure and the strength of sedimentary substrates.The presence of characteristic, void-filling microspar is integral to preservation of MT structures. Cathodoluminescence (CL) identification of this characteristic microspar within MT voids, in pore space of coarse-grained facies, and interstitially within fine-grained facies adjacent to MT voids suggests that MT voids and cement share a common genesis. Because microspar cores are similar in size and morphology to vaterite precipitated experimentally in the presence of a variety of dissolved organic molecules, we suggest that precipitation of MT microspar was intimately linked with gas production during organic decomposition within the host substrate. In this scenario, gas production would result in pore fluids with elevated concentrations of dissolved organic molecules, which would initiate precipitation of MT microspar when the pore fluids come in contact with supersaturated Proterozoic seawater. Restriction of MT largely to Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic strata likely reflects a critical level of carbonate saturation that limited early substrate lithification, thereby allowing void production but remained high enough that organic catalysts were able to initiate precipitation of MT microspar.},

	Abstract = {New constraints on the tectonic evolution of the Neo-Tethys Ocean indicate that at ∼90-70 Ma and at ∼50-40 Ma, vast quantities of mafic and ultramafic rocks were emplaced at low latitude onto continental crust within the tropical humid belt. These emplacement events correspond temporally with, and are potential agents for, the global climatic cooling events that terminated the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum and the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. We model the temporal effects of CO2 drawdown from the atmosphere due to chemical weathering of these obducted ophiolites, and of CO2 addition to the atmosphere from arc volcanism in the Neo-Tethys, between 100 and 40 Ma. Modeled variations in net CO2-drawdown rates are in excellent agreement with contemporaneous variation of ocean bottom water temperatures over this time interval, indicating that ophiolite emplacement may have played a major role in changing global climate. We demonstrate that both the lithology of the obducted rocks (mafic/ultramafic) and a tropical humid climate with high precipitation rate are needed to produce significant consumption of CO2. Based on these results, we suggest that the low-latitude closure of ocean basins along east-west trending plate boundaries may also have initiated other long-term global cooling events, such as Middle to Late Ordovician cooling and glaciation associated with the closure of the Iapetus Ocean.},

	Abstract = {A deep-sea temperature record for the past 50 million years has been produced from the magnesium/calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) in benthic foraminiferal calcite. The record is strikingly similar in form to the corresponding benthic oxygen isotope (δ18O) record and defines an overall cooling of about 12{\textdegree}C in the deep oceans with four main cooling periods. Used in conjunction with the benthic δ18O record, the magnesium temperature record indicates that the first major accumulation of Antarctic ice occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene (34 million years ago) and was not accompanied by a decrease in deep-sea temperatures.},

@article{Bataille2017a,
	Abstract = {The composition of igneous rocks in the continental crust has changed throughout Earth{\textquoteright}s history. However, the impact of these compositional variations on chemical weathering, and by extension on seawater and atmosphere evolution, is largely unknown. We use the strontium isotope ratio in seawater [(87Sr/86Sr)seawater] as a proxy for chemical weathering, and we test the sensitivity of (87Sr/86Sr)seawater variations to the strontium isotopic composition (87Sr/86Sr) in igneous rocks generated through time. We demonstrate that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in igneous rocks is correlated to the epsilon hafnium (εHf) of their hosted zircon grains, and we use the detrital zircon record to reconstruct the evolution of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in zircon-bearing igneous rocks. The reconstructed 87Sr/86Sr variations in igneous rocks are strongly correlated with the (87Sr/86Sr)seawater variations over the last 1000 million years, suggesting a direct control of the isotopic composition of silicic magmatism on (87Sr/86Sr)seawater variations. The correlation decreases during several time periods, likely reflecting changes in the chemical weathering rate associated with paleogeographic, climatic, or tectonic events. We argue that for most of the last 1000 million years, the (87Sr/86Sr)seawater variations are responding to changes in the isotopic composition of silicic magmatism rather than to changes in the global chemical weathering rate. We conclude that the (87Sr/86Sr)seawater variations are of limited utility to reconstruct changes in the global chemical weathering rate in deep times.},

Here we show that long-term chemical weathering rates can be measured by combining physical erosion rates, inferred from cosmogenic nuclides, with dissolution losses, inferred from the rock-to-soil enrichment of insoluble elements. We used this method to measure chemical weathering rates across 22 mountainous granitic catchments that span a wide range of erosion rates and climates. Chemical weathering rates correlate strongly with physical erosion rates but only weakly with climate, implying that, by regulating erosion rates, tectonic uplift may significantly accelerate chemical weathering rates in granitic landscapes.},

@article{Peters2017a,
	Abstract = {Stromatolites are abundant in shallow marine sediments deposited before the evolution
of animals, but in the modern ocean they are restricted to locations where the activity of
animals is limited. Overall decline in the abundance of stromatolites has, therefore, been
attributed to the evolution of substrate-modifying metazoans, with Phanerozoic stromatolite
resurgences attributed to the aftermaths of mass extinctions. Here we use a comprehensive
stratigraphic database, the published literature, and a machine reading system to show that
the rock record-normalized occurrence of stromatolites in marine environments in North
America exhibits three phases: an initial Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2500 Ma) increase, a sustained
interval of dominance during the Proterozoic (2500-800 Ma), and a late Neoproterozoic
(700-541 Ma) decline to lower mean prevalence during the Phanerozoic (541-0 Ma). Stromatolites
continued to exhibit large changes in prevalence after the evolution of metazoans,
and they transiently achieved Proterozoic-like prevalence during the Paleozoic. The aftermaths
of major mass extinctions are not well correlated with stromatolite resurgence. Instead,
stromatolite occurrence is well predicted by the prevalence of dolomite, a shift in carbonate
mineralogy that is sensitive to changes in water-column and pore-water chemistry occurring
during continent-scale marine transgressive-regressive cycles.},

@article{Holland2012a,
	Abstract = {Although major Late Ordovician glaciation was confined to the terminal Ordovician Hirnantian Stage, lasting less than 2 million years, recent isotopic evidence suggests a prolonged interval of slow growth in polar ice caps. Tropical carbonate platforms from passive margins and epicontinental seas offer the opportunity to monitor changes in eustatic sea-level changes that accompanied this transition from a greenhouse towards an icehouse climate. The Late Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite of northern Wyoming and adjacent states preserves such a transition. The Bighorn Dolomite was deposited on a northeastward-facing, subequatorial platform, and it consists of three third-order depositional sequences. Each is bounded by a regional erosional surface, commonly with erosional truncation visible at outcrop scale and commonly mantled by a distinctive brecciated horizon. The Bighorn Dolomite is dominated by highly bioturbated and fossiliferous open marine shallow subtidal facies, but portions also contain dolomitic bioturbated restricted marine shallow subtidal and laminated peritidal facies, as well as thin-bedded argillaceous and fossiliferous deep subtidal limestone. The three depositional sequences preserve a transition in their internal cyclicity that is consistent with computer modeling of the stratigraphic signal of increasing period and amplitude of eustatic sea-level changes. The lowermost sequence, which spans the Lander and Steamboat Point members, consists of homogeneous, acyclic, shallow subtidal facies, with a few meter-scale peritidal parasequences near its top. The middle sequence, which corresponds to the Leigh Member, contains acyclic to weakly cyclic restricted shallow subtidal and peritidal facies. The uppermost sequence, consisting of the Horseshoe Mountain Member, is dominated by five decameter-scale parasequences composed of open marine shallow subtidal, restricted shallow subtidal, and peritidal facies. Overall, the Bighorn Dolomite is interpreted to represent deposition during a shift from low-amplitude (a few meters), short-period (∼ 20 kyr) cyclicity to moderate-amplitude (∼ 10 m), long-period (100 kyr) cyclicity indicating a shift from greenhouse conditions towards icehouse conditions, a shift that agrees with recent isotopic evidence for changing Late Ordovician climate.},

	Abstract = {The history of atmospheric O2 partial pressures (Po2) is inextricably linked to the coevolution of life and Earth{\textquoteright}s biogeochemical cycles. Reconstructions of past Po2 rely on models and proxies but often markedly disagree. We present a record of Po2 reconstructed using O2/N2 ratios from ancient air trapped in ice. This record indicates that Po2 declined by 7 per mil (0.7\%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O2 sinks were ~2\% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and pyrite driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene erosion rates. The 800,000-year record of steady average carbon dioxide partial pressures (Pco2) but declining Po2 provides distinctive evidence that a silicate weathering feedback stabilizes Pco2 on million-year time scales.},

	Abstract = {The use of Ca isotopes as a proxy for mass flux imbalances in the Ca cycle is evaluated critically. A compiled Ca isotope record for the last 45 Ma, derived from bulk nannofossil ooze and with a temporal resolution of ∼0.5 Ma, and an interpretation of the record are presented in the context of the global Ca cycle. This analysis, which assumes that nannofossil ooze records isotopic variations in seawater, indicates a dynamic Ca cycle in the Cenozoic. Such dynamic behavior has serious implications for the C cycle and suggests feedbacks between the Ca and C cycles to stabilize, or buffer, the oceanic carbon reservoir. Alternative applications of the Ca isotope proxy are investigated, using numerical models to determine the extent to which Ca isotopes are sensitive to other aspects of the Ca cycle; the results of the simulations are applied to specific cases in the Cenozoic. The simulations illustrate how variations in the global fractionation factor between calcium carbonate and seawater can produce trends similar to those observed when comparing previously published Ca isotopic compositions of marine barite to the nannofossil ooze record. The large drop in the δ44Ca value of bulk nannofossil ooze near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary can be reconciled in two ways, either as a substantial increase in weathering relative to sedimentation or as an indicator of changing depositional mode within the ocean. Though the preferred interpretation is not clear at present, it is evident that Ca isotopes stand to be a unique proxy for Ca cycling once the isotope systematics are elucidated.},

	Abstract = {A new geochemical budget for the modern marine carbonate sink helps to explain the major features of the Phanerozoic Ca isotope record. A large compilation of Ca isotope ratios for modern carbonates, incorporating more than 50 new measurements, represents the quantitatively important components of the system. With this data set, distinct Ca isotope ratios are identified for different types of marine carbonate, the balance of which has changed over time with shifts between calcite and aragonite seas and with the development of pelagic calcification during the Mesozoic. It is suggested that large-scale changes in the Ca isotope ratio of seawater, as exemplified by that in the Carboniferous, were no longer possible after Jurassic time because of the generation of a deep-sea calcite sink expressed by deposition of foraminiferal-coccolith ooze across the world ocean. This work demonstrates the close connection between isotopic cycling, carbonate sedimentation, seawater chemistry, and evolutionary trends.},

@article{Payne2010a,
	Abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction horizon is marked by an abrupt shift in style of carbonate sedimentation and a negative excursion in the carbon isotope (δ13C) composition of carbonate minerals. Several extinction scenarios consistent with these observations have been put forward. Secular variation in the calcium isotope (δ44/40Ca) composition of marine sediments provides a tool for distinguishing among these possibilities and thereby constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we report δ44/40Ca across the Permian-Triassic boundary from marine limestone in south China. The δ44/40Ca exhibits a transient negative excursion of ∼0.3‰ over a few hundred thousand years or less, which we interpret to reflect a change in the global δ44/40Ca composition of seawater. CO2-driven ocean acidification best explains the coincidence of the δ44/40Ca excursion with negative excursions in the δ13C of carbonates and organic matter and the preferential extinction of heavily calcified marine animals. Calcium isotope constraints on carbon cycle calculations suggest that the average δ13C of CO2 released was heavier than -28‰ and more likely near -15‰; these values indicate a source containing substantial amounts of mantle- or carbonate-derived carbon. Collectively, the results point toward Siberian Trap volcanism as the trigger of mass extinction.},

	Abstract = {The carbon cycle model GEOCARBSULF is extended by dividing the weathering of silicates into volcanic and non-volcanic rocks. The proportion of volcanic weathering is calculated as a function of time from the oceanic record of 87Sr/86Sr. The volcanic proportion is then used to modify the equations for calculating atmospheric CO2 by the addition of a new non-dimensional volcanic weathering factor. The effect of uplift and physical erosion on weathering is also modified by using only the distribution over time of the abundance of sandstones and shales, and not Sr isotopic data that had been used previously. Results indicate moderate change from GEOCARBSULF in the distribution of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time. This includes an increased minimum in CO2 during the Late Ordovician, in agreement with the presence of a continental glaciation at that time, and a shift of maximum Mesozoic values from the Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous.},

	Abstract = {Although it is not known when or where life on Earth began, some of the earliest habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3,770 million and possibly 4,280 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown among carbonate rosettes and magnetite-haematite granules, and is associated with carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3,770 million years ago.},

@article{Noda2016a,
	Abstract = {Forearc basins are one of the fundamental sedimentary basins, and they preserve various geological phenomena arising from dynamic interactions between subducting and overriding plates along convergent plate boundaries. Previous studies have proposed descriptive classification schemes for such basins and performed analog experiments and numerical simulations examining basin formation and evolution; however, the great variability of forearc basins means that a comprehensive understanding of these features remains elusive. This paper proposes a new classification scheme for forearc basins from the viewpoints of material transfer between the two plates (accretionary or nonaccretionary) and the long-term strain field in the basin (compressional or extensional) by using characteristics of 41 modern forearc basins. Geometric characteristics were also analyzed in order to reveal the relationship to subduction zone dynamics, including material transfer at the plate boundary (accretion/erosion), plate convergence configurations and kinematics, and the mechanics of strain and its partitioning. Compressional accretionary-type basins, which are characterized by landward-tilting strata and the landward migration of depocenters, show a constant width/thickness, ratio indicating self-similar growth of the basin as the outer wedge builds up. Extensional accretionary-type basins develop normal faults in the basin, probably due to a gravitational instability of the outer wedge. An increase of sediment flux at the trench may grow the accretionary prism and thicken the subduction channel faster, leading to a reduction of basal and internal shear strengths of the outer wedge. Subsidence caused by crustal thinning characterizes the nonaccretionary-type basins, which have thin trench-fill sediments, large forearc slopes, steady widths of the outer wedge, and variable width/thickness ratios of the basins. From these results, the sediment flux at the trench and the plate boundary can be considered as a dominant factor that determines accretion or erosion of the outer wedge and uplift or subsidence of the outer-arc high, and that is also responsible for the style of deposition in the forearc basin. An increase or decrease of the sediment flux may change the type, geometry, and deformation manner of the forearc basin. The results of this study provide important clues to further our understanding of dynamic interactions between forearc basins and subduction zone processes.},

@article{Grossman1996a,
	Abstract = {To improve our ability to use minor and trace element (MTE) variation in biotic carbonates as diagenetic and paleoenvironmental indicators, we performed electron probe microanalysis on more than 100 Late Pennsylvanian brachiopod shells from Texas, Kansas, Missouri, and New Mexico. Texturally preserved specimens of the genera Crurithyris, Composita, and Neospirifer from all three regions were analyzed, as were Eridmatus specimens from Texas. Twenty measurements were made in two transects across each shell. Shell microstructure and cathodoluminescence were described for each spot analyzed. Three modern shells were analyzed for comparison. Diagenesis, as indicated by cathodoluminescence and/or absence of microstructure, tends to enrich shells in Fe and Mn (X/Ca >= 0.7 mmol/mol) and deplete shells in Na and S. Mg content shows no consistent trend with diagenesis. In fabric-retentive, nonluminescent shell areas, Mg, Na, and S contents vary twofold to sevenfold depending on taxonomy, microstructure, and season. Overall, taxonomy is the dominant factor controlling MTE composition. Na and S concentrations are consistently highest in Crurithyris and Eridmatus, intermediate in Neospirifer, and lowest in Composita. In taxa with mixed microstructure (Composita, Neospirifer), secondary fibrous layer calcite contains 1.5 to 2 times more Na than does interlayer prismatic calcite. Thus, whole-shell Na contents of these taxa depend on the proportion of fibrous and prismatic shell. Seasonal cycles are revealed in MTE transects across growth lines. Mg, Na, and S contents commonly vary by more than a factor of two between maxima (presumably summer) and minima (winter) within the same shell. Retention of taxonomic, microstructural, and seasonal effects in shell chemistry argues for preservation of original chemistry in fabric-retentive, nonluminescent Paleozoic brachiopod shells.},

@article{Saltzman2005a,
	Abstract = {The timing and causes of the transition to an icehouse climate in the Late Ordovician are controversial. Results of an integrated δ13C and sequence stratigraphic analysis in Nevada show that in the Late Ordovician Chatfieldian Stage (mid-Caradoc) a positive δ13C excursion in the upper part of the Copenhagen Formation was closely followed by a regressive event evidenced within the prominent Eureka Quartzite. The Chatfieldian δ13C excursion is known globally and interpreted to record enhanced organic carbon burial, which lowered atmospheric pCO2 to levels near the threshold for ice buildup in the Ordovician greenhouse climate. The subsequent regressive event in central Nevada, previously interpreted as part of a regional tectonic adjustment, is here attributed in part to sea-level drawdown from the initiation of continental glaciation on Gondwana. This drop in sea level-which may have contributed to further cooling through a reduction in poleward heat transport and a lowering of pCO2 by suppressing shelf-carbonate production-signals the transition to a Late Ordovician icehouse climate ∼10 m.y. before the widespread Hirnantian glacial maximum at the end of the Ordovician.},

	Abstract = {The end Ordovician glaciation is distinct among Phanerozoic glaciations in that CO2, levels were generally high, yet major continental ice sheets accumulated on the Gondwana supercontinent. New oxygen isotopic data indicate substantial changes in sea-water temperatures and ice volume coinciding with glacio-eustatic changes in sea level reflecting the growth and decay of the Gondwana ice cap. Major glaciation was apparently confined to the Hirnantian and was 0.5-1 m.y. long, rather than the 35 m.y. of earlier estimates. Carbon isotope values indicate significant changes in carbon cycling as the oceans changed from a state with warm saline bottom waters to a state with cold deep-water circulation and then back again. We believe that the changes in the carbon cycle effected a reduction in PCO2 levels in the oceans and atmosphere and thus promoted glaciation but were unable to sustain icehouse conditions in a greenhouse world.},

@article{Clark2009a,
	Abstract = {Global sea level rises and falls as ice sheets and glaciers melt and grow, providing an integrated picture of the changes in ice volume but little information about how much individual ice fields are contributing to those variations. Knowing the regional structure of ice variability during glaciations and deglaciations will clarify the mechanisms of the glacial cycle. Clark et al. (p. 710) compiled and analyzed more than 5000 radiocarbon and cosmogenic surface exposure ages in order to develop a record of maximum regional ice extent around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. The responses of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres differed significantly, which reveals how the evolution of specific ice sheets affected sea level and provides insight into how insolation controlled the deglaciation.We used 5704 14C, 10Be, and 3He ages that span the interval from 10,000 to 50,000 years ago (10 to 50 ka) to constrain the timing of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in terms of global ice-sheet and mountain-glacier extent. Growth of the ice sheets to their maximum positions occurred between 33.0 and 26.5 ka in response to climate forcing from decreases in northern summer insolation, tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric CO2. Nearly all ice sheets were at their LGM positions from 26.5 ka to 19 to 20 ka, corresponding to minima in these forcings. The onset of Northern Hemisphere deglaciation 19 to 20 ka was induced by an increase in northern summer insolation, providing the source for an abrupt rise in sea level. The onset of deglaciation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet occurred between 14 and 15 ka, consistent with evidence that this was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level ~14.5 ka.},

@article{Husson2015a,
	Abstract = {The most negative carbon isotope excursion in Earth history is found in carbonate rocks of the Ediacaran Period (635-541 Ma). Known colloquially as the ``Shuram'' excursion, workers have long noted its broad concordance with the rise of abundant macro-scale fossils in the rock record, collectively known as the ``Ediacaran Biota.'' Thus, the Shuram excursion has been interpreted by many in the context of a dramatically changing redox state of the Ediacaran oceans-for example, a result of methane cycling in a low O2 atmosphere, the final destruction of a large pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the step-wise oxidation of the Ediacaran oceans. More recently, diagenetic interpretations of the Shuram excursion have challenged the various redox models, with the very negative δ13C values of Ediacaran carbonates explained via sedimentary in-growth of very δ13C depleted authigenic carbonates, meteoric alteration or late-stage burial diagenesis. A stratigraphic and sedimentological context is required to discriminate between these explanatory models, and to determine whether the Shuram excursion can be used to evaluate oxygenation in terminal Neoproterozoic oceans. Here we present chemo-stratigraphic data (δ13C, δ18O, and trace element abundances) from 15 measured sections of the Ediacaran-aged Wonoka Formation (Fm.) of South Australia. In some locations, the Wonoka Fm. is ∼700 meters (m) of mixed shelf limestones and siliciclastics that record a 17 permil δ13C excursion (−12 to +5‰). Further north in the basin, the Wonoka Fm. is host to deep (∼1 km) paleocanyons, which are partly filled by tabular-clast carbonate breccias. Canyon-filling ceased during ongoing sedimentation on the shelf interior (the ``canyon-shoulder''), as evidenced by upper canyon-shoulder units that overlie and cap certain canyon-fill sequences. The unprecedented size of the chemostratigraphic dataset presented here (2671 δ13C-δ18O measurements from the canyon-shoulder, 1393 δ13C-δ18O measurements from canyon clasts, and 11 different trace elements measured on 247 Wonoka Fm. carbonate samples), when coupled with the unique canyon-shoulder to canyon-fill depositional system of the Wonoka Fm., allows for new insights into Ediacaran carbon isotope systematics. The excursion is preserved in a remarkably consistent fashion across 12,000 km2 of basin area; fabric-altering diagenesis, where present, occurs at the sub-meter vertical scale, results in < 1 permil offsets in δ13C and cannot be used to explain the full δ13C excursion. Multi-variate analysis of the dataset allows for rigorous assessment of different potential carbonate sources for the Wonoka canyon-fill breccias. Eroded and transported canyon-shoulder carbonates are the most likely source, thus requiring a syn-depositional age for the extraordinary range of δ13C values (−12 to +5‰) observed in both the Wonoka Fm. canyon-shoulder and canyon-fill breccias. Geological observations (for example, excellent preservation of sedimentary structures in Wonoka carbonates, absence of top-down alteration profiles associated with exposure surfaces) do not provide first-order evidence for the meteoric or authigenic carbonate models. Thus, the balance of evidence supports either a primary origin or syn-depositional, fabric-retentive diagenesis for the deep negative δ13C excursion hosted in the Wonoka Formation of South Australia.},

@article{Galbraith2017a,
	Abstract = {Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied widely over the glacial cycles of the past 800,000 years. But despite this variability, Antarctic ice cores have shown that CO2 concentrations were very similar during all the coldest points of these cycles. Remarkably, the recurring minimum CO2 concentrations (190{$[$}thinsp{$]$} {$[$}plusmn{$]$} {$[$}thinsp{$]$}7{$[$}thinsp{$]$}ppm) fall on the lower bound of any known in Earth history. Here we show that although the volume of terrestrial ice sheets was normally distributed over the past 800,000 years, as might be expected from the approximately normal distribution of the orbital forcing that drove the glacial cycles, Antarctic temperatures have a strong cold mode, whereas CO2 concentrations have both a cold mode and a central mode. Although multiple explanations are possible, the recurring CO2 minima and pronounced cold modes are consistent with a strong negative feedback to decreasing CO2 that resisted further cooling on timescales shorter than 10,000 years. We suggest that one possible negative feedback is CO2-limitation of photosynthesis, either directly or via CO2-limitation of N2 fixation, which could have inhibited further lowering of CO2 by reducing carbon storage.},

	Abstract = {The cycles of carbon and oxygen at the Earth surface are intimately linked, where the burial of organic carbon into sediments represents a source of oxygen to the surface environment. This coupling is typically quantified through the isotope records of organic and inorganic carbon. Yet, the late Neoproterozoic Eon, the time when animals first evolved, experienced wild isotope fluctuations which do not conform to our normal understanding of the carbon cycle and carbon-oxygen coupling. We interpret these fluctuations with a new carbon cycle model and demonstrate that all of the main features of the carbonate and organic carbon isotope record can be explained by the release of methane hydrates from an anoxic dissolved organic carbon-rich ocean into an atmosphere containing oxygen levels considerably less than today.},

@article{Kump1991a,
	Abstract = {Large negative excursions in marine carbonate δ13C are commonly associated with period boundaries and mass extinctions. Explanations for these events must be consistent with limitations imposed by carbon-isotope mass balance. At steady state (i.e., for excursions lasting more than 105 yr), the surface ocean δ13C is set by the organic fraction of the total carbon burial rate and the magnitude of the photosynthetic isotope effect. The δ13C of the deep ocean and the surface-to-deep isotope gradient are set by both the organic fraction of the ocean's remineralized particulate flux and the magnitude of the isotope effect. Thus it is the carbon-isotope composition of the deep ocean that is most reflective of internal oceanic processes; the surface ocean records changes in the longer term throughput of carbon in the system. The cessation of organic export from the surface ocean, such as is presumed to have caused the Strangelove ocean condition of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, leads to an isotopically homogeneous ocean in decades to centuries. If this condition persists, the ocean's isotopic composition approaches that of the riverine weathering input (in 105 yr). Failure to approach this value during the K/T event suggests continued production and burial of organic carbon, dominantly in either terrestrial or shallow-marine environments.},

@article{Brenchley2003a,
	Abstract = { The two phases of the Late Ordovician mass extinction are approximately coeval with the periods of rapid climate change associated with the onset and demise of the Gondwanan glaciation. In this paper we argue that the distinctive Late Ordovician carbon isotope profile provides a chrono strati graph ic ``ruler'' against which a sequence of environmental and biotic events may be located. The ruler also allows regional and global high-resolution correlation of successions representing very different environments.Cores from the Upper Ordovician succession of Estonia and Latvia record a large δ13Ccarbonate excursion (up to 6‰), with a similar profile shape. The consistent relationship between the chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphy in the Baltic region suggests that the isotope profile has a regional chronostratigraphic value. The presence of similar profiles in Nevada, United States, suggests that the excursion is a global chronostratigraphic signal. This interpretation enables a detailed correlation to be made between Upper Ordovician shallow-marine and basinal sequences that have wholly different faunas.Successions in the Baltic area and in Canada that do not display the model profile are interpreted as incomplete. Reinterpretation of these important successions significantly modifies the global database used to assess the pattern of diversity change during the mass extinction.Key levels of environmental change have been located against the carbon isotope profile. New oxygen isotope data from brachiopod and ostracode calcite set tight limits on the start of the glacial events. Cooling and sea-level fall started at the same stratigraphic level as the start of the carbon isotope excursion. The later rise in sea level and fall in oxygen isotope values record the end of the glaciation. These restrict the duration of the main glaciation to only 1.5 graptolite zones. We propose that models of the carbon cycle should be adapted to be consistent with the temporal relationships between carbon cycling, sea-level fall, and temperature change documented here.The chronostratigraphic ``ruler'' provided by the carbon isotope profiles is used as a scale to determine the sequence of biotic changes and to allow high-resolution correlation of biotic events at different locations. This approach identifies regional similarities and differences in the patterns of extinction. The main phase of graptolite extinction in the Monitor Range, Nevada, for example, is synchronous with the chitinozoan extinction in the Baltic region, but chitinozoan taxa survive to higher levels in Nevada. The benthic faunas in the Baltic region demonstrate that the main extinction event corresponded with the beginning of the isotope excursion at the start of the Hirnantian-the level at which the marine environment started to change rapidly-but that there were further extinctions of species within the early Hirnantian. The cold-adapted Hirnantia fauna did not appear immediately after the extinction in this area.The relationship between the second phase of extinction and the carbon isotope excursion is less clear, but the available data suggest that the extinction coincides with a time of rapid environmental change, but not at the inception of environmental change, as happened in the first phase.},

@article{Finnegan2012a,
	Abstract = {Selectivity patterns provide insights into the causes of ancient extinction events. The Late Ordovician mass extinction was related to Gondwanan glaciation; however, it is still unclear whether elevated extinction rates were attributable to record failure, habitat loss, or climatic cooling. We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North American fossil occurrences within a spatiotemporally explicit stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by stratigraphic truncation or environmental shifts at the end of the Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure; rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16 explanatory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively tropical taxa during the late Katian interval. These results indicate that glacioeustatic sea-level fall and tropical ocean cooling played important roles in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction in Laurentia.},

@article{Jones2011a,
	Abstract = {Globally documented carbon isotope excursions provide time-varying signals that can be used for high-resolution stratigraphic correlation. We report detailed inorganic and organic carbon isotope curves from carbonate rocks of the Ellis Bay and Becscie Formations spanning the Ordovician-Silurian boundary on Anticosti Island, Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Strata of the Anticosti Basin record the development of a storm-dominated tropical carbonate ramp. These strata host the well-known Hirnantian positive carbon isotope excursion, which attains maximum values of ∼4.5‰ in carbonate carbon of the Laframboise Member or the Fox Point Member of the Becscie Formation. The excursion also occurs in organic carbon, and δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg values covary such that no reproducible Δ13C (= δ13Ccarb - δ13Corg) excursion is observed. The most complete stratigraphic section, at Laframboise Point in the west, shows the characteristic shape of the Hirnantian Stage excursion at the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) for the Hirnantian Stage in China and the Silurian System in Scotland. We therefore suggest that the entire Hirnantian Stage on Anticosti Island is confined to the Laframboise and lower Fox Point Members.By documenting discontinuities in the architecture of the carbon isotope curve at multiple stratigraphic sections spanning a proximal to distal transect across the sedimentary basin, we are able to reconstruct glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations corresponding to maximum glacial conditions associated with the end-Ordovician ice age. The combined litho- and chemostratigraphic approach provides evidence for the diachroneity of the oncolite bed and Becscie limestones; the former transgresses from west to east, and the latter progrades from east to west. The sea-level curve consistent with our sequence-stratigraphic model indicates that glacioeustatic sea-level changes and the positive carbon isotope excursion were not perfectly coupled. Although the start of the isotope excursion and the initial sea-level drawdown were coincident, the peak of the isotope excursion did not occur until after sea level had begun to rise. Carbon isotope values did not return to baseline until well after the Anticosti ramp was reflooded. The sea-level-δ13Ccarb relationship proposed here is consistent with the ``weathering'' hypothesis for the origin of the Hirnantian δ13Ccarb excursion.},

@article{Kunzmann2017a,
	Abstract = {Various geochemical records suggest that atmospheric O2 increased in the Ediacaran (635{\textendash}541 Ma), broadly coincident with the emergence and diversification of large animals and increasing marine ecosystem complexity. Furthermore, geochemical proxies indicate that seawater sulfate levels rose at this time too, which has been hypothesized to reflect increased sulfide oxidation in marine sediments caused by sediment mixing of the newly evolved macrofauna. However, the exact timing of oxygenation is not yet understood, and there are claims for significant oxygenation prior to the Ediacaran. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that physical mixing of sediments did not become important until the late Silurian. Here we report a multiple sulfur isotope record from a ca. 835{\textendash}630 Ma succession from Svalbard, further supported by data from Proterozoic strata in Canada, Australia, Russia, and the United States, in order to investigate the timing of oxygenation. We present isotopic evidence for onset of globally significant bacterial sulfur disproportionation and reoxidative sulfur cycling following the 635 Ma Marinoan glaciation. Widespread sulfide oxidation helps to explain the observed first-order increase in seawater sulfate concentration from the earliest Ediacaran to the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary by reducing the amount of sulfur buried as pyrite. Expansion of reoxidative sulfur cycling to a global scale also indicates increasing environmental O2 levels. Thus, our data suggest that increasing atmospheric O2 levels may have played a role in the emergence of the Ediacaran macrofauna and increasing marine ecosystem complexity.},

@article{Caves2016a,
	Abstract = {There remains substantial debate concerning the relative roles of tectonics and global climate in driving the evolution of climate in Central Asia. Today, interior Asia-including the Taklamakan, Gobi, and Ordos Deserts-is exceptionally arid and is surrounded by distinct rainfall boundaries, such as those generated by the Asian monsoon systems to the east and south and those generated by high topography to the north and west. Determining how and why these boundaries have varied over the Neogene is hindered by the lack of a single proxy that can be broadly applied through space and time. We construct isoscapes of pedogenic carbonate δ13C (δ13Cc) over the Neogene in Asia by combining a compilation of 2236 published measurements with new data from three localities in northern Central Asia. Pedogenic carbonate δ13C records local aridity-excepting localities impacted by C4 grasslands and during large changes in atmospheric pCO2-through variations in soil respiration, depth of carbonate formation, and the effect of water stress on plant δ13C. Together, these effects reflect changes in both primary productivity and mean annual precipitation. Throughout the Neogene, we find consistent and exceptionally high δ13Cc in interior Asia with a ring of lower δ13Cc that demarcates higher precipitation. This persistent ring of lower δ13Cc corresponds in the south and east with the influence of the Asian monsoon systems; in the west and north, it reflects both orographic rainfall due to uplift of the Tian Shan and to moisture delivery by the mid-latitude westerlies. Finally, δ13Cc and, hence, aridity increases regionally in the latest Neogene, reflecting the effects of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooling. This widespread ``de-greening'' would have increased regional albedo and modified basin-scale water balances, resulting in greater dust fluxes due to reduced vegetative cover and precipitation.},

@article{Halevy2017a,
	Abstract = {Iron formations deposited in marine settings during the Precambrian represent large sinks of iron and silica, and have been used to reconstruct environmental conditions at the time of their formation. However, the observed mineralogy in iron formations, which consists of iron oxides, silicates, carbonates and sulfides, is generally thought to have arisen from diagenesis of one or more mineral precursors. Ferric iron hydroxides and ferrous carbonates and silicates have been identified as prime candidates. Here we investigate the potential role of green rust, a ferrous-ferric hydroxy salt, in the genesis of iron formations. Our laboratory experiments show that green rust readily forms in early seawater-analogue solutions, as predicted by thermodynamic calculations, and that it ages into minerals observed in iron formations. Dynamic models of the iron cycle further indicate that green rust would have precipitated near the iron redoxcline, and it is expected that when the green rust sank it transformed into stable phases within the water column and sediments. We suggest, therefore, that the precipitation and transformation of green rust was a key process in the iron cycle, and that the interaction of green rust with various elements should be included in any consideration of Precambrian biogeochemical cycles.},

@article{Boiteau2016a,
	Abstract = {Nearly all iron dissolved in the ocean is complexed by strong organic ligands of unknown composition. The effect of ligand composition on microbial iron acquisition is poorly understood, but amendment experiments using model ligands show they can facilitate or impede iron uptake depending on their identity. Here we show that siderophores, organic compounds synthesized by microbes to facilitate iron uptake, are a dynamic component of the marine ligand pool in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Siderophore concentrations in iron-deficient waters averaged 9 pM, up to fivefold higher than in iron-rich coastal and nutrient-depleted oligotrophic waters, and were dominated by amphibactins, amphiphilic siderophores with cell membrane affinity. Phylogenetic analysis of amphibactin biosynthetic genes suggests that the ability to produce amphibactins has transferred horizontally across multiple Gammaproteobacteria, potentially driven by pressures to compete for iron. In coastal and oligotrophic regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean, amphibactins were replaced with lower concentrations (1-2 pM) of hydrophilic ferrioxamine siderophores. Our results suggest that organic ligand composition changes across the surface ocean in response to environmental pressures. Hydrophilic siderophores are predominantly found across regions of the ocean where iron is not expected to be the limiting nutrient for the microbial community at large. However, in regions with intense competition for iron, some microbes optimize iron acquisition by producing siderophores that minimize diffusive losses to the environment. These siderophores affect iron bioavailability and thus may be an important component of the marine iron cycle.},

	Abstract = {New Re-Os dates obtained from black shales overlying the Sturtian and Areyonga glacial deposits in southern and central Australia, respectively, challenge the prevailing consensus of three Neoproterozoic glaciations. The end of Sturtian glaciation in the Adelaide Rift Complex is constrained by a Re-Os date of 643.0 $\pm$ 2.4 Ma from the overlying Tindelpina Shale Member (basal Tapley Hill Formation). A Re-Os date of 657.2 $\pm$ 5.4 Ma for the basal Aralka Formation constrains the age of the underlying Areyonga glacial deposits in the Amadeus Basin. The Re-Os ages show that the Sturtian and Areyonga glacial deposits are younger than other radiometrically dated (ca. 685-750 Ma) Neoproterozoic glacial intervals previously regarded as possible correlatives. Thus, the ``Sturtian'' ice age was markedly diachronous, and/or there was more than one ``Sturtian''-type glaciation. Some Neoproterozoic glacial deposits may represent the products of regional and diachronous glaciation associated with protracted breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia rather than ``snowball'' or ``slushball'' Earth ice ages.},

@article{Gumsley2017a,
	Abstract = {The first significant buildup in atmospheric oxygen, the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), began in the early Paleoproterozoic in association with global glaciations and continued until the end of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion ca. 2,060 Ma. The exact timing of and relationships among these events are debated because of poor age constraints and contradictory stratigraphic correlations. Here, we show that the first Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of the GOE occurred between ca. 2,460 and 2,426 Ma, ∼100 My earlier than previously estimated, based on an age of 2,426 $\pm$ 3 Ma for Ongeluk Formation magmatism from the Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. This age helps define a key paleomagnetic pole that positions the Kaapvaal Craton at equatorial latitudes of 11$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 6$\,^{\circ}$ at this time. Furthermore, the rise of atmospheric oxygen was not monotonic, but was instead characterized by oscillations, which together with climatic instabilities may have continued over the next ∼200 My until ≤2,250-2,240 Ma. Ongeluk Formation volcanism at ca. 2,426 Ma was part of a large igneous province (LIP) and represents a waning stage in the emplacement of several temporally discrete LIPs across a large low-latitude continental landmass. These LIPs played critical, albeit complex, roles in the rise of oxygen and in both initiating and terminating global glaciations. This series of events invites comparison with the Neoproterozoic oxygen increase and Sturtian Snowball Earth glaciation, which accompanied emplacement of LIPs across supercontinent Rodinia, also positioned at low latitude.},

@article{Harlan2003a,
	Abstract = {Precise U-Pb baddeleyite dating of mafic igneous rocks provides evidence for a widespread and synchronous magmatic event that extended for >2400 km along the western margin of the Neoproterozoic Laurentian craton. U-Pb baddeleyite analyses for eight intrusions from seven localities ranging from the northern Canadian Shield to northwestern Wyoming-southwestern Montana are statistically indistinguishable and yield a composite U-Pb concordia age for this event of 780.3 $\pm$ 1.4 Ma (95% confidence level). This 780 Ma event is herein termed the Gunbarrel magmatic event. The mafic magmatism of the Gunbarrel event represents the largest mafic dike swarm yet identified along the Neoproterozoic margin of Laurentia. The origin of the mafic magmatism is not clear, but may be related to mantle-plume activity or upwelling asthenosphere leading to crustal extension accompanying initial breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and development of the  proto- Pacific Ocean. The mafic magmatism of the Gunbarrel magmatic event at 780 Ma predates the voluminous magmatism of the 723 Ma Franklin igneous event of the northwestern Canadian Shield by ∼60 m.y. The precise dating of the extensive Neoproterozoic Gunbarrel and Franklin magmatic events provides unique time markers that can ultimately be used for robust testing of Neoproterozoic continental reconstructions.},

@article{Collins2002a,
	Abstract = { Abstract Recent work in central and northern Madagascar has identified five tectonic units of the East African Orogen (EAO), a large collisional zone fundamental to the amalgamation of Gondwana. These five units are the Antongil block, the Antananarivo block, the Tsaratanana sheet, the Itremo sheet, and the Bemarivo belt. Geochronological, lithological, metamorphic, and geochemical characteristics of these units and their relationships to each other are used as a type area to compare and contrast with surrounding regions of Gondwana. The Antananarivo block of central Madagascar, part of a broad band of pre‐1000‐Ma continental crust that stretches from Yemen through Somalia and eastern Ethiopia into Madagascar, is sandwiched between two suture zones we interpret as marking strands of the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Ocean. The eastern suture connects the Al‐Mukalla terrane (Yemen), the Maydh greenstone belt (northern Somalia), the Betsimisaraka suture (east Madagascar), and the Palghat‐Cauvery shear zone system (south India). The western suture projects the Al‐Bayda terrane (Yemen) through a change in crustal age in Ethiopia to the region west of Madagascar. Our new framework for the central EAO links the Mozambique belt with the Arabian/Nubian Shield and highlights the power of tectonic analysis in unraveling the complex tectonic collage of the EAO. },

@article{Grasby2017a,
	Abstract = {Sedimentary records from the northwest margin of Pangea and the Tethys show anomalously high Hg levels at the latest Permian extinction boundary. Background δ202Hg values are consistent with normal marine conditions but exhibit negative shifts coincident with increased Hg concentrations. Hg isotope mass-independent fractionation (Δ199Hg) trends are consistent with volcanic input in deep-water marine environments. In contrast, nearshore environments have Δ199Hg signatures consistent with enhanced soil and/or biomass input. We hypothesize that the deep-water signature represents an overall global increase in volcanic Hg input and that this isotope signature is overwhelmed in nearshore locations due to Hg from terrestrial sources. High-productivity nearshore regions may have experienced stressed marine ecosystems due to enhanced Hg loading.},

	Abstract = {Roughly 240 million years ago (Ma), scleractinian corals rapidly expanded and diversified across shallow marine environments. The main driver behind this evolution is uncertain, but the ecological success of modern reef-building corals is attributed to their nutritional symbiosis with photosynthesizing dinoflagellate algae. We show that a suite of exceptionally preserved Late Triassic (ca. 212 Ma) coral skeletons from Antalya (Turkey) have microstructures, carbonate 13C/12C and 18O/16O, and intracrystalline skeletal organic matter 15N/14N all indicating symbiosis. This includes species with growth forms conventionally considered asymbiotic. The nitrogen isotopes further suggest that their Tethys Sea habitat was a nutrient-poor, low-productivity marine environment in which photosymbiosis would be highly advantageous. Thus, coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis was likely a key driver in the evolution and expansion of shallow-water scleractinians.},

	Abstract = {Stable-isotope stratigraphies have been generated for brachiopods from five Late Pennsylvanian sections (upper Winchell cycle, Finis shale, Colony Creek shale, Necessity cycle, and Wayland shale) in north-central Texas to examine the relationship between isotopic composition, paleoenvironment, and sea-level change. Nonluminscent calcite from more than 300 specimens of 4 species of brachiopod (Composita subtilita, Crurithyris planoconvexa, Eridmatus texana, Neospirifer cameratus) was analyzed. Sedimentological and paleontological data are used as evidence for paleoenvironmental change.Higher δ18O values of brachiopod shells occur in intervals of greatest paleodepth as indicated by fossil content and lithology. These higher δ18O values reflect a decrease in bottom temperature with increased water depth. Normalized for paleodepth, the δ18O values of the brachiopods are similar in all of the units except the Wayland shale, for which they are ∼0.5‰ higher. This suggests either cooler temperatures or greater continental ice volume during the time of Wayland deposition.Brachiopod δ13C values do not correlate with paleodepth. The δ13C values of Composita are consistently higher than those of Crurithyris and Eridmatus. Composita δ13C values are similar in the upper Winchell cycle, Necessity cycle, and Wayland shale, averaging 4.8‰ to 4.9‰. In contrast, Crurithyris δ13C values range from 2.5‰ in the Necessity cycle to 4.4‰ in the Wayland shale; Eridmatus values are also lowest in the Necessity cycle (3.4‰) and greatest in the Wayland shale (3.9‰). These differences between species do not correlate with susceptibility to diagenesis and appear to reflect a pore-water influence on semi-infaunal (Crurithyris) forms. The δ13C values of Composita shells suggest that the Late Pennsylvanian ocean off eastern Laurussia was enriched in 13C by about 1‰ relative to the ocean off western Laurussia.},

@article{Lau2016a,
	Abstract = {Delayed Earth system recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction is often attributed to severe ocean anoxia. However, the extent and duration of Early Triassic anoxia remains poorly constrained. Here we use paired records of uranium concentrations ([U]) and 238U/235U isotopic compositions (δ238U) of Upper Permian−Upper Triassic marine limestones from China and Turkey to quantify variations in global seafloor redox conditions. We observe abrupt decreases in [U] and δ238U across the end-Permian extinction horizon, from ∼3 ppm and −0.15‰ to ∼0.3 ppm and −0.77‰, followed by a gradual return to preextinction values over the subsequent 5 million years. These trends imply a factor of 100 increase in the extent of seafloor anoxia and suggest the presence of a shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that inhibited the recovery of benthic animal diversity and marine ecosystem function. We hypothesize that in the Early Triassic oceans-characterized by prolonged shallow anoxia that may have impinged onto continental shelves-global biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystem structure became more sensitive to variation in the position of the OMZ. Under this hypothesis, the Middle Triassic decline in bottom water anoxia, stabilization of biogeochemical cycles, and diversification of marine animals together reflect the development of a deeper and less extensive OMZ, which regulated Earth system recovery following the end-Permian catastrophe.},

@article{Roark2016a,
	Abstract = {The relationship between Permian-Carboniferous glacial cycles and low-latitude climate remains a subject of vigorous debate. This study investigated seasonality and regional environmental variability in a portion of central equatorial Pangea during a late Pennsylvanian highstand using stable isotope and trace-element analyses of brachiopod shells from the Virgilian Ames Member of the Conemaugh Group in the Appalachian Basin, U.S.A. Well-preserved, thick-shelled Neospirifer dunbari specimens were serially sampled across growth bands to elucidate a record of seasonal variability during the life of the organisms. Because Neospirifer only colonized this marginal basin during near-maximum highstands, when stable, near-marine salinities were established, these data are a direct proxy for intra-annual climate fluctuations during interglacial times.Neospirifer specimens show remarkably little internal chemical variability, with δ18O generally fluctuating by 0.4‰ or less and δ13C fluctuating by less than 1.5‰ within a single specimen. Moreover, total δ18O variability between all specimens is only ∼1.5‰. This lack of variation reflects a homogeneous, nonseasonal to weakly seasonal climate during the Ames highstand. Both δ18O and δ13C are ∼1.5‰ lower than those of other Virgilian specimens from regions with a more proximal connection to the open ocean, suggesting at least moderate freshwater influence in the Appalachian Basin during this time, although salinities remained close enough to marine levels to maintain stenohaline fauna. Thus, brachiopod seasonal records indicate normal moist tropical conditions during this penultimate Carboniferous interglacial, with no evidence for strong monsoonal variations in temperature or rainfall.},

@article{Kastens1988a,
	Abstract = {Leg 107 of the Ocean Drilling Program drilled a west-northwest-east-southeast transect of seven sites across the Tyrrhenian Sea, the youngest of the sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea. Sites 654, 653, 652, and 656 document the rifting and subsidence of the Sardinia passive continental margin. On the upper margin (Site 654), we cored a classic transgressive sequence: subaerial conglomerates, overlain by oyster-bearing sands, overlain by marine marl. Comparison between the recovered lithologies and seismic reflection profiles suggests that the synrift sediments on the upper margin are Tortonian (late Miocene) to Messinian (latest Miocene) in age, whereas synrift sediments on the lower margin are Messinian to Pliocene in age. During the Messinian desiccation of the Mediterranean, Sites 654 and 653, now on the upper Sardinian margin, apparently occupied a basinal setting, where they received nannoplankton-bearing clays interbedded with laminated gypsum. Sites 656 and 652, now on the lower Sardinia margin, were apparently higher standing during the desiccation event; their Messinian facies are subaerial and lacustrine, respectively. We infer from these lines of evidence that tilting and subsidence occurred more than a million years earlier on the upper margin than on the lower margin. Such diachroneity can be interpreted in terms of migration of the zone of maximum extension above a "rolling-back" subduction zone, or in terms of extension of continental crust, by shear along a deep "detachment fault."Sites 655, 651, and 650 were drilled into two small basalt-floored basins of the central and eastern Tyrrhenian. Emplacement of basaltic crust in the central Tyrrhenian (Vavilov Basin) apparently began more than a million years before, emplacement of basaltic crust in the eastern Tyrrhenian (Marsili Basin). This observation is compatible with previous suggestions that the Tyrrhenian has grown southeastward in response to "rollback" of the down-going slab that currently dips northwestward under the toe of Italy. At the easternmost site, high vesicularity of the basalt and benthic foram assemblages in the oldest sediments imply that the basalt erupted in water shallower than 2,500 m. It has apparently subsequently subsided to its present depth of >4,100 m below sea level nearly three times as fast as normal subsidence of crust formed at a mid-ocean ridge.},

	Abstract = {The life span of each main class of sedimentary basin is estimated from published data. Life spans vary over at least three orders of magnitude, from <1 m.y. for trench basins to >100 m.y. for passive-margin and intracratonic basins. The life-span estimates are used to calibrate a chart of basin groups that focuses on the likely basin fates; i.e., depositional, deformational, or thermal. Consequent fates, predetermined by the tectonic setting of a particular basin class, are distinguished from contingent fates, which are independent of basin type. Accretion of trench-basin fill is, for example, a consequent fate, whereas inversion (far-field shortening) of a rift basin is a contingent fate. Life-span data are also used to calibrate the Wilson Cycle and indicate that it has an average duration of ∼260 m.y. This is certainly an underestimate, because basin life spans are an imperfect proxy for the duration of subduction and collision zones.},

	Abstract = { The Keraf Suture, formed during the Neoproterozoic consolidation of Gondwana, is a ∼500 km long, ∼50 km wide, N‐trending suture between the Neoproterozoic Arabian‐Nubian Shield in the east and the older Nile Craton to the west. The Keraf Suture is superimposed on E‐ and NE‐trending structures on both sides. The northern part of the suture is dominated by N‐trending, upright folds, whereas the southern part is characterized by N‐ and NNW‐trending, sinistral, strike‐slip faults. A major antiform defines a structural divide between the northern and southern parts of the suture. 40Ar/39Ar ages on biotite and hornblendes separated from a deformed granitic body indicate that the sinistral movement along the N‐ and NNW‐trending faults took place at ∼580 Ma. The difference in structural styles along strike is due to formation of the Keraf Suture by sinistral transpression, which accompanied early NW‐SE oblique collision between East and West Gondwana at ∼650-600 Ma and terminal collision at ∼580 Ma. },

@article{Tziperman2011a,
	Abstract = {The glaciations of the Neoproterozoic Era (1,000 to 542 MyBP) were preceded by dramatically light C isotopic excursions preserved in preglacial deposits. Standard explanations of these excursions involve remineralization of isotopically light organic matter and imply strong enhancement of atmospheric CO2 greenhouse gas concentration, apparently inconsistent with the glaciations that followed. We examine a scenario in which the isotopic signal, as well as the global glaciation, result from enhanced export of organic matter from the upper ocean into anoxic subsurface waters and sediments. The organic matter undergoes anoxic remineralization at depth via either sulfate- or iron-reducing bacteria. In both cases, this can lead to changes in carbonate alkalinity and dissolved inorganic pool that efficiently lower the atmospheric CO2 concentration, possibly plunging Earth into an ice age. This scenario predicts enhanced deposition of calcium carbonate, the formation of siderite, and an increase in ocean pH, all of which are consistent with recent observations. Late Neoproterozoic diversification of marine eukaryotes may have facilitated the episodic enhancement of export of organic matter from the upper ocean, by causing a greater proportion of organic matter to be partitioned as particulate aggregates that can sink more efficiently, via increased cell size, biomineralization or increased C∶N of eukaryotic phytoplankton. The scenario explains isotopic excursions that are correlated or uncorrelated with snowball initiation, and suggests that increasing atmospheric oxygen concentrations and a progressive oxygenation of the subsurface ocean helped to prevent snowball glaciation on the Phanerozoic Earth.},

	Abstract = {Negative carbon isotope anomalies in carbonate rocks bracketing Neoproterozoic glacial deposits in Namibia, combined with estimates of thermal subsidence history, suggest that biological productivity in the surface ocean collapsed for millions of years. This collapse can be explained by a global glaciation (that is, a snowball Earth), which ended abruptly when subaerial volcanic outgassing raised atmospheric carbon dioxide to about 350 times the modern level. The rapid termination would have resulted in a warming of the snowball Earth to extreme greenhouse conditions. The transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean would result in the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate in warm surface waters, producing the cap carbonate rocks observed globally.},

	Abstract = {The Tonian-Cambrian interval (c. 0.9-0.5 Ga) witnessed major tectonic, climatic and chemical changes to the Earth system and culminated in the Ediacaran-Cambrian radiation of animals. Negative carbon isotope (δ13C) excursions of extraordinary magnitude form the backdrop to all these events and are consistent with the presence of a vast marine organic carbon reservoir that changed its size due to periodic imbalances between organic production (as an oxidant source) and terrestrial oxidant sinks. Prior to both Cryogenian glaciations, this pool of long-lived organic carbon may have become substantially depleted, leading to a weakening of the regulation of climate and oxygen. The late Ediacaran Shuram anomaly probably represents a third depletion event, which was followed by oxygenation and the Ediacaran-Cambrian radiation. The evolutionary diversification of animals shortened the ocean residence time of organic carbon and introduced new carbon cycle feedbacks that together helped to mould the modern Earth system.},

@article{Partin2016a,
	Abstract = {During the Sturtian and Marinoan ``snowball Earth'' episodes, ice cover is thought to have extended from polar to tropical latitudes. We test the supposition that such an extreme glacial climate, not repeated in the subsequent ∼635 m.y. of Earth history, would have reduced the vigor of the hydrologic cycle and thus diminished sediment flux to the oceans. With >500 sediment accumulation rates to characterize Sturtian and Marinoan deposits, we find median accumulation rates at least four to 15 times slower than expected for Phanerozoic glaciomarine deposits as characterized by >10,000 rates. Our comparison is conservative with respect to time span, latitude, and distance from the ice margin. Phanerozoic accumulation rates decrease systematically when averaged over longer time spans. Comparisons were drawn, therefore, at 5 and 57 m.y. time spans to match minimum Marinoan and Sturtian durations, respectively. Cenozoic glaciomarine accumulation also slows with increasing latitude from temperate to polar climates and with increasing distance from the ice margin. After accounting for time span, snowball Earth deposits at low latitude are found to be thinner than would be expected either for high-latitude Cenozoic glacial deposits or for very distal glaciomarine abyssal muds with ice-rafted debris. The rate discrepancy is not readily attributed to overestimates of the total Marinoan or Sturtian durations. If sediment fluxes during warm melt intervals did approach Phanerozoic rates, these intervals must have occupied a much smaller proportion of snowball Earth episodes than in younger glacial climates.},

@article{McKenzie2016a,
	Abstract = {Volcanism and erosion can feed into long-term climate change, but determining their relative importance is challenging. Erosion is known to be a carbon sink and is thought to play an outsized role in shifting global climate. However, McKenzie et al. suggest that long-term oscillations in climate may be tied to the amount of continental arc volcanism (see the Perspective by Kump). A global compilation of arc volcano-produced zircons over the past 700 million years revealed good correlation between warm and cool epochs with the waxing and waning of volcanism. Thus, volcanism may be a more important driver and erosion a less important sink for very long-term climate changes.Science, this issue p. 444; see also p. 411Variations in continental volcanic arc emissions have the potential to control atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and climate change on multimillion-year time scales. Here we present a compilation of ~120,000 detrital zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) ages from global sedimentary deposits as a proxy to track the spatial distribution of continental magmatic arc systems from the Cryogenian period to the present. These data demonstrate a direct relationship between global arc activity and major climate shifts: Widespread continental arcs correspond with prominent early Paleozoic and Mesozoic greenhouse climates, whereas reduced continental arc activity corresponds with icehouse climates of the Cryogenian, Late Ordovician, late Paleozoic, and Cenozoic. This persistent coupled behavior provides evidence that continental volcanic outgassing drove long-term shifts in atmospheric CO2 levels over the past ~720 million years.},

@article{Lechte2016a,
	Abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Sturtian glaciation is considered to be among the most severe glaciations in Earth history, possibly encompassing the entire planet and lasting for more than 50 m.y. Iron formations are globally associated with Sturtian glacial successions, although the influence of glaciation on the genesis of these iron formations remains contentious. Here we examine the Sturtian iron formations of Namibia and Australia that feature finely laminated ironstones containing up to 55% total iron. These ironstones are repeatedly interbedded with massive diamictites, yet dropstones and other clastic input are nearly absent in the laminated ironstone facies. Intercalated diamictites are variably ferruginous and characterized by a strong glacial influence with evidence of glaciotectonism. The ferruginous facies are laterally discontinuous and commonly occupy paleobathymetric depressions. Rare earth element signatures from these iron formations are similar to those from modern seawater but lack cerium anomalies. The paradox of dropstone-free, laminated sediments intimately interlaminated with massive ice-proximal diamictites can be resolved by deposition under an ice shelf. Polynya activity and the mixing of cold, oxygenated glacial fluids with ferruginous seawater via an ice pump mechanism may explain the deposition of these iron formations and their restriction to Sturtian glacial successions globally.},

	Abstract = {Cryogenian (∼720-635 Ma) global glaciations (the snowball Earth) represent the most extreme ice ages in Earth's history. The termination of these snowball Earth glaciations is marked by the global precipitation of cap carbonates, which are interpreted to have been driven by intense chemical weathering on continents. However, direct geochemical evidence for the intense chemical weathering in the aftermath of snowball glaciations is lacking. Here, we report Mg isotopic data from the terminal Cryogenian or Marinoan-age Nantuo Formation and the overlying cap carbonate of the basal Doushantuo Formation in South China. A positive excursion of extremely high δ26Mg values (+0.56 to +0.95)-indicative of an episode of intense chemical weathering-occurs in the top Nantuo Formation, whereas the siliciclastic component of the overlying Doushantuo cap carbonate has significantly lower δ26Mg values (<+0.40), suggesting moderate to low intensity of chemical weathering during cap carbonate deposition. These observations suggest that cap carbonate deposition postdates the climax of chemical weathering, probably because of the suppression of carbonate precipitation in an acidified ocean when atmospheric CO2 concentration was high. Cap carbonate deposition did not occur until chemical weathering had consumed substantial amounts of atmospheric CO2 and accumulated high levels of oceanic alkalinity. Our finding confirms intense chemical weathering at the onset of deglaciation but indicates that the maximum weathering predated cap carbonate deposition.},

@article{Dumas2006a,
	Abstract = {A series of wave-tunnel experiments was conducted to investigate the conditions under which hummocky and swaley cross-stratification form. Isotropic 3-dimensional (3-D) hummocky bed forms were generated under long wave periods (∼8-10 s) and moderate oscillatory velocities (Uo ∼50-90 cm/s) with very weak (< 5 cm/s) to no unidirectional flow. Hummocks became anisotropic with the addition of only a small unidirectional current (5-10 cm/s), and began to resemble unidirectional dunes when the unidirectional current was increased above 10 cm/s. Synthetic aggradation of the hummocky bed forms at high (4.2 mm/min) and low (1 mm/min) rates generated stratification resembling hummocky and swaley cross-stratification, respectively. Based on these findings, we suggest that hummocky cross-stratification optimally forms above (but near) storm wave base where aggradation rates during storms are high enough to preserve hummocks but unidirectional current speeds are sufficiently low to generate low-angle, isotropic cross-stratification. Swaley cross-stratification is also hypothesized to be deposited by an aggrading hummocky bed between fair-weather and storm wave base, but in shallower water where aggradation rates are low enough to cause preferential preservation of swales.},

@article{Strauss2014a,
	Abstract = {Biostratigraphy underpins the Phanerozoic time scale, but its application to pre-Ediacaran strata has remained limited because Proterozoic taxa commonly have long or unknown stratigraphic ranges, poorly understood taphonomic constraints, and/or inadequate geochronological context. Here we report the discovery of abundant vase-shaped microfossils from the Callison Lake dolostone of the Coal Creek inlier (Yukon, Canada) that highlight the potential for biostratigraphic correlation of Neoproterozoic successions using species-level assemblage zones of limited duration. The fossiliferous horizon, dated here by Re-Os geochronology at 739.9 $\pm$ 6.1 Ma, shares multiple species-level taxa with a well-characterized assemblage from the Chuar Group of the Grand Canyon (Arizona, USA), dated by U-Pb on zircon from an interbedded tuff at 742 $\pm$ 6 Ma. The overlapping age and species assemblages from these two deposits suggest biostratigraphic utility, at least within Neoproterozoic basins of Laurentia, and perhaps globally. The new Re-Os age also confirms the timing of the Islay δ13Ccarbonate anomaly in northwestern Canada, which predates the onset of the Sturtian glaciation by >15 m.y. Together these data provide global calibration of sedimentary, paleontological, and geochemical records on the eve of profound environmental and evolutionary change.},

@article{Pratt1998a,
	Abstract = {Proterozoic argillaceous lime mudstones commonly contain molar-tooth structure, a curious synsedimentary feature consisting of crumpled, generally vertically oriented veins filled with calcite microspar. Long enigmatic, these veins are interpreted here as earthquake-induced deformation structures. A model is proposed whereby violent ground motion caused shrinkage, dewatering, and fissuring of the colloidal sea-floor sediment of clay and lime mud. A slurry of equant particles of lime mud, segregated from the clay platelets trapped in the matrix, was expelled into these voids. The host bed underwent as much as 80% compaction as well as shear, causing the lime mud-filled fissures to be ptygmatically folded and shingled both vertically and horizontally, and in places pulled apart. This lime mud lithified rapidly by high-Mg calcite grain growth, such that subsequent earthquakes shattered the folded veins. In the Belt basin of western North America, tsunamis from different events created currents that transported ooids and coarse sand from shoals into deeper water, and scoured deeply into the now-consolidated sediment, leaving behind a lag of vein fragments.Molar-tooth structure is a signature of basin tectonism recorded specifically in argillaceous lime mudstones deposited in low-energy settings above the thermocline in supersaturated marine water. Syneresis cracks are the counterpart in terrigenous facies, in that silt and sand were injected into the shrinkage fissures. This process points to the importance of seismically induced compaction under negligible burial. Smectite might have made up a significant proportion of the sediment, making it more conducive to shrinkage. The absence of molar-tooth structure in Phanerozoic strata is ascribed mainly to changes in sediment rheology brought about by increased organic binding due to diversification of the microbiota.},

@article{Smith1968a,
	Abstract = {The most characteristic type of "molar-tooth" structure in the Belt-Purcell succession of western North America is briefly described and illustrated. It is interpreted as a system of originally linear, vertical calcite sheets or ribbons, locally united by horizontal members to form an open framework and attributed to some form of algal or allied organic activity. Subsequent to their formation in water-rich silts and silty clays at depths of less than 1.3 m. below the sedimentary interface, compaction crinkled the vertical sheets and, in some cases, produced structures resembling the ptygmatic veins in metamorphic rocks. The geometry and mechanism of deformation of isolated vertical sheets approximate to theoretical models used to investigate folding in rocks. Although these models can in principle be used to determine various properties of the calcite sheets, the available data permit an estimate of the "viscosity" only-of the order of 400-40,000 poise at the time of their formation. Further investigation of these structures is needed to establish their organic origin with certainty; to determine the environmental conditions controlling their formation; to explain their restriction to later Precambrian sequences; to investigate their possible use as a Precambrian form-fossil; and to compare their deformation more fully with theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {The Huqf Supergroup, Oman, contains volcanic horizons with the potential to calibrate Neoproterozoic events and chemostratigraphy using U-Pb zircon geochronology. A tuffaceous bed near the base, within the lower (Ghubrah) diamictite and beneath a lower cap carbonate, provides the first U-Pb zircon date obtained from within a Neoproterozoic glacial deposit. This date of 723 +16/−10 Ma suggests a Sturtian age. Diamictites about 1 km higher in the section are overlain by the Hadash cap dolomite, which compares with cap dolomites above Marinoan glacial units elsewhere. A U-Pb zircon age of 544.5 $\pm$ 3.3 Ma from ignimbrites in the Fara Formation, near the top of the supergroup, is just beneath that of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary (ca. 543 Ma), consistent with the presence of the Neoproterozoic skeletal-fossil Cloudina in correlative subsurface rocks. This revised chronology confirms the existence of four negative δ13C excursions between ca. 723 and 543 Ma, the lower two of which are clearly associated with glaciations.},

	Abstract = {U-Pb zircon data from the uppermost Cottons Breccia, representing the Marinoan glacial-postglacial transition on King Island, Tasmania, provide the first direct age constraint on the Cryogenian-Ediacaran boundary in Australia. Zircons in four samples from the topmost meter of the Cottons Breccia, dated by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe, exhibit two modes ca. 660 Ma and ca. 635 Ma. The younger component predominates in the uppermost sample, a possibly volcanolithic dolomitic sandstone, apparently lacking glacially transported debris, in the transition to cap carbonate. Chemical abrasion-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) U-Pb dating of euhedral zircons from that sample yields a weighted-mean age of 636.41 $\pm$ 0.45 Ma. Equivalence to published TIMS ash bed dates from Cryogenian-Ediacaran transitional strata in Namibia (635.51 $\pm$ 0.82 Ma, within glacial deposit) and China (635.23 $\pm$ 0.84 Ma, 2 m above glacial deposit) supports correlation of those strata to the Australian type sections and globally synchronous deglaciation at the end of the Cryogenian Period.},

	Abstract = {Dropstone-bearing glaciomarine sedimentary rocks of the Ghaub Formation within metamorphosed Neoproterozoic basinal strata (Swakop Group) in central Namibia contain interbedded mafic lava flows and thin felsic ash beds. U-Pb zircon geochronology of an ash layer constrains the deposition of the glaciomarine sediments to 635.5 $\pm$ 1.2 Ma, providing an age for what has been described as a ``Marinoan-type'' glaciation. In addition, this age provides a maximum limit for the proposed lower boundary of the terminal Proterozoic (Ediacaran) system and period. Combined with reliable age constraints from other Neoproterozoic glacial units-the ca. 713 Ma Gubrah Member (Oman) and the 580 Ma Gaskiers Formation (Newfoundland)-these data provide unequivocal evidence for at least three, temporally discrete, glacial episodes during Neoproterozoic time with interglacial periods, characterized by prolonged positive δ13C excursions, lasting at most ∼50- 80 m.y.},

@article{Zhou2004a,
	Abstract = {The most complete Neoproterozoic successions in south China contain three diamictite intervals in the Changan, Tiesiao, and Nantuo Formations. The youngest and most widespread Nantuo glacial deposit overlies the Datangpo Formation and underlies the fossil- rich Doushantuo Formation. Previous authors have correlated the Nantuo diamictite to either Sturtian or Marinoan glacial deposits elsewhere. Here we report sedimentary and δ13C chemostratigraphic data of the Doushantuo cap dolostone, which overlies the Nantuo Formation. Facies-dependent variation in δ13C is interpreted as evidence for spatial heterogeneity in δ13C and/or temporal diachroneity in the initiation of cap carbonate sedimentation. Sedimentary and chemostratigraphic data are indicative of a Marinoan age for the Nantuo glaciation. This inference is supported by a new U-Pb zircon age of 663 $\pm$ 4 Ma from a tuffaceous bed in the Datangpo Formation. The new date and other isotopic ages from south China constrain the age of the Changan and Tiesiao glaciation(s) as between 761 $\pm$ 8 Ma and 663 $\pm$ 4 Ma, and the Nantuo glaciation as between 663 $\pm$ 4 Ma and 599 $\pm$ 4 Ma.},

	Abstract = {The snowball Earth hypothesis predicts globally synchronous glaciations that persisted on a multimillion year time scale. Geochronological tests of this hypothesis have been limited by a dearth of reliable age constraints bracketing these events on multiple cratons. Here we present four new Re-Os geochronology age constraints on Sturtian (717{\textendash}660 Ma) and Marinoan (635 Ma termination) glacial deposits from three different paleocontinents. A 752.7 {\textpm} 5.5 Ma age from the base of the Callison Lake Formation in Yukon, Canada, confirms nonglacial sedimentation on the western margin of Laurentia between ca. 753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 {\textpm} 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 {\textpm} 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confirms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717{\textendash}660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the first direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 {\textpm} 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia. Together, these data unite Re-Os and U-Pb geochronological constraints and provide a refined temporal framework for Cryogenian Earth history.},

	Abstract = {The Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman, contains an important record of Neoproterozoic history, including evidence for two glaciations, a massive reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. New U-Pb geochronologic data provide precise constraints on the age of several key stratigraphic levels in the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup and its subjacent crystalline basement rocks. The basement ages constrain an interval of felsic magmatism to have occurred from at least 840 Ma to approximately 810 Ma. Detrital zircons from several stratigraphic levels within the Huqf Supergroup yield ages in excess of 2.5 Ga, suggesting proximity of Archean crust during the Neoproterozoic evolution of the eastern Arabian Peninsula. Volcanic ash beds intercalated within the Huqf Supergroup were dated in the Oman Mountains, and in several subsurface wells (South Oman Salt Basin). Glacial deposits of the Abu Mahara Group in the Oman Mountains (Ghubrah Formation) contain volcaniclastic rocks that are approximately 713 Ma; overlying syn-glacial turbiditic sandstones of the Fiq Formation yield a suite of detrital zircon dates ranging from 920 to 664 Ma so that deposition of at least the upper Fiq must have post-dated 664 Ma. In the South Oman Salt Basin, volcaniclastic deposits intercalated within glaciogenic strata of the Fiq Formation yielded zircons, the youngest of which is about 645 Ma. These data indicate two distinct episodes of glaciation at approximately 713 and <645 Ma.The uppermost Ara Group of the Huqf Supergoup contains multiple ash beds within its carbonate strata, where an age of roughly 547 Ma is reported for rocks that occur above strata marked by a pronounced negative (-12‰) to positive (+4‰) excursion in carbon isotope composition. Higher in the Ara sequence, three distinct ash beds dated at about 543 Ma, 542 Ma, and 541 Ma closely approximate the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in Oman. The dramatic carbon isotope excursion of ∼16 permil in the Shuram Formation (middle Nafun Group) has a firm maximum age of approximately 620 Ma as provided by detrital zircon ages from the base of the formation. Interpolation and downward extrapolation from the Ara Group ages, coupled with correlation to other global strata, suggests the base of the Shuram C-isotope excursion to be on the order of 560 Ma, with an estimated duration of approximately 5 to 11 m.y. This excursion is inferred to post-date the last well-documented Neoproterozoic glaciation (about 582 Ma) and is broadly coincident with the appearance of complex organisms in the fossil record.},

Between 3.1 and 10.7 Ma the δ18O of surface waters approached or exceeded 0‰ standard mean ocean water (SMOW) in the dry season. Since 9.5 Ma the magnitude of seasonal variability in δ18O has remained essentially unchanged. Both observations imply that the Tibetan Plateau had attained sufficient elevation and area prior to 10.7 Ma to support a strong Asian monsoon. These data also imply that the δ18O of wet-season rainfall was significantly more negative (−9.5‰ SMOW) prior to 7.5 Ma than after (−6.5‰ SMOW). If this change is attributable to a lessening of the amount effect in rainfall, this agrees with floral and soil geochemical data that indicate increasing aridity beginning at 7.5 Ma.},

New 87Sr/86Sr measurements from Nevada indicate that the rapid shift began in the Pygodus serra conodont zone of the upper Darriwilian Stage. We use a numerical model to explore the hypothesis that volcanic weathering provided the flux of nonradiogenic Sr to the oceans. A close balance between volcanic outgassing and CO2 consumption from weathering produced steady pCO2 levels and climate through the middle Katian, consistent with recent Ordovician paleotemperature estimates. In the late Katian, outgassing was reduced while volcanic weathering continued, and resulted in a cooling episode leading into the well-known end-Ordovician glaciation.},

Previous temperature estimates of up to \~{}70{\textdegree}C have spawned controversial speculation that the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater must have evolved over geological time. We present a very different global climate record determined by ion microprobe oxygen isotope analyses of Early Ordovician{\textendash}Silurian conodonts. This record shows a steady cooling trend through the Early Ordovician reaching modern equatorial temperatures that were sustained throughout the Middle and Late Ordovician. This favorable climate regime implies not only that the oxygen isotopic composition of Ordovician seawater was similar to that of today, but also that climate played an overarching role in promoting the unprecedented increases in biodiversity that characterized this period.},

	Abstract = {The Ordovician 87Sr/86Sr isotope seawater curve is well established and shows a decreasing trend until the mid-Katian. However, uncertainties in calibration of this curve to biostratigraphy and geochronology have made it difficult to determine how the rates of 87Sr/86Sr decrease may have varied, which has implications for both the stratigraphic resolution possible using Sr isotope stratigraphy and efforts to model the effects of Ordovician geologic events. We measured 87Sr/86Sr in conodont apatite in North American Ordovician sections that are well studied for conodont biostratigraphy, primarily in Nevada, Oklahoma, the Appalachian region, and Ohio Valley. Our results indicate that conodont apatite may provide an accurate medium for Sr isotope stratigraphy and strengthen previous reports that point toward a significant increase in the rate of fall in seawater 87Sr/86Sr during the Middle Ordovician Darriwilian Stage. Our 87Sr/86Sr results suggest that Sr isotope stratigraphy will be most useful as a high-resolution tool for global correlation in the mid-Darriwilian to mid-Sandbian, when the maximum rate of fall in 87Sr/86Sr is estimated at ∼5.0-10.0 × 10-5 per m.y. Variable preservation of conodont elements limits the precision for individual stratigraphic horizons. Replicate conodont analyses from the same sample differ by an average of ∼4.0 × 10-5 (the 2σ standard deviation is 6.2 × 10-5), which in the best case scenario allows for subdivision of Ordovician time intervals characterized by the highest rates of fall in 87Sr/86Sr at a maximum resolution of ∼0.5-1.0 m.y. Links between the increased rate of fall in 87Sr/86Sr beginning in the mid-late Darriwilian (Phragmodus polonicus to Pygodus serra conodont zones) and geologic events continue to be investigated, but the coincidence with a long-term rise in sea level (Sauk-Tippecanoe megasequence boundary) and tectonic events (Taconic orogeny) in North America provides a plausible explanation for the changing magnitude and 87Sr/86Sr of the riverine Sr flux to the oceans.},

	Abstract = {Understanding ancient climate changes is hampered by the inability to disentangle trends in ocean temperature from trends in continental ice volume. We used carbonate {\textquotedblleft}clumped{\textquotedblright} isotope paleothermometry to constrain ocean temperatures, and thereby estimate ice volumes, through the Late Ordovician{\textendash}Early Silurian glaciation. We find tropical ocean temperatures of 32{\textdegree} to 37{\textdegree}C except for short-lived cooling by ~5{\textdegree}C during the final Ordovician stage. Evidence for ice sheets spans much of the study interval, but the cooling pulse coincided with a glacial maximum during which ice volumes likely equaled or exceeded those of the last (Pleistocene) glacial maximum. This cooling also coincided with a large perturbation of the carbon cycle and the Late Ordovician mass extinction.},

@article{Halverson2005a,
	Abstract = {Glacial deposits of Sturtian and Marinoan age occur in the well-studied Neoproterozoic successions of northern Namibia, South Australia, and northwestern Canada. In all three regions, the Marinoan glaciation is presaged by a large negative δ13C anomaly, and the cap carbonates to both glacial units share a suite of unique sedimentological, stratigraphic, and geochemical features. These global chronostratigraphic markers are the bases of a new correlation scheme for the Neoproterozoic that corroborates radiometric data that indicate that there were three glacial epochs between ca. 750 and 580 Ma. Intraregional correlation of Neoproterozoic successions in the present-day North Atlantic region suggests that glacial diamictite pairs in the Polarisbreen Group in northeastern Svalbard and the Tillite Group in eastern Greenland were deposited during the Marinoan glaciation, whereas the younger of a pair of glacials (Mortensnes Formation) in the Vestertana Group of northern Norway was deposited during the third (Gaskiers) Neoproterozoic glaciation. Gaskiers-aged glacial deposits are neither globally distributed nor overlain by a widespread cap carbonate but are associated with an extremely negative δ13C anomaly. The chronology developed here provides the framework for a new, high-resolution model carbon-isotope record for the Neoproterozoic comprising new δ13C (carbonate) data from Svalbard (Akademikerbreen Group) and Namibia (Otavi Group) and data in the literature from Svalbard, Namibia, and Oman. A new U-Pb zircon age of 760 {\textpm} 1 Ma from an ash bed in the Ombombo Subgroup in Namibia provides the oldest direct time-calibration point in the compilation, but the time scale of this preliminary δ13C record remains poorly constrained.},

@article{Pu2016a,
	Abstract = {The snowball Earth hypothesis predicts that low-latitude glaciation lasted millions of years while CO2 built up to critical levels to culminate in catastrophic deglaciation in a supergreenhouse climate. The Gaskiers Formation of eastern Newfoundland (Canada) has been attributed to a snowball glaciation event, but the lack of robust paleomagnetic data and precise geochronological constraints has precluded tests of the hypothesis. Here we present high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology (chemical abrasion{\textendash}isotope dilution{\textendash}thermal ionization mass spectrometry) from eight tuffs from multiple distant stratigraphic sections that bracket glacial diamictites and the first appearance of large Ediacaran fossils. Including internal error, deposition of the Gaskiers diamictite on the Avalon Peninsula is constrained to have been between 580.90 {\textpm} 0.40 and 579.88 {\textpm} 0.44 Ma, and the Trinity diamictite on Bonavista Peninsula was deposited between 579.63 {\textpm} 0.15 and 579.24 {\textpm} 0.17 Ma. Assuming approximately synchronous deglaciation, these results imply a maximum duration for deposition of the Trinity diamictite of <=340 k.y.; this is inconsistent with the multimillion year duration predicted by the snowball Earth hypothesis. Our geochronologic data also constrain the first appearance datum of Ediacaran fossils to \&lt;9.5 m.y. after the Gaskiers glaciation. Thus, despite existing paleomagnetic constraints that indicate that marine ice sheets extended to low to middle latitudes, it appears that Earth narrowly escaped a third Neoproterozoic snowball glaciation just prior to the late Ediacaran expansion of metazoan ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Microfossils, stromatolites, preserved lipids and biologically informative isotopic ratios provide a substantial record of bacterial diversity and biogeochemical cycles in Proterozoic (2500{\textendash}541 Ma) oceans that can be interpreted, at least broadly, in terms of present-day organisms and metabolic processes. Archean (more than 2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks add at least a billion years to the recorded history of life, with sedimentological and biogeochemical evidence for life at 3500 Ma, and possibly earlier; phylogenetic and functional details, however, are limited. Geochemistry provides a major constraint on early evolution, indicating that the first bacteria were shaped by anoxic environments, with distinct patterns of major and micronutrient availability. Archean rocks appear to record the Earth{\textquoteright}s first iron age, with reduced Fe as the principal electron donor for photosynthesis, oxidized Fe the most abundant terminal electron acceptor for respiration, and Fe a key cofactor in proteins. With the permanent oxygenation of the atmosphere and surface ocean ca 2400 Ma, photic zone O2 limited the access of photosynthetic bacteria to electron donors other than water, while expanding the inventory of oxidants available for respiration and chemoautotrophy. Thus, halfway through Earth history, the microbial underpinnings of modern marine ecosystems began to take shape.This article is part of the themed issue {\textquoteleft}The new bacteriology{\textquoteright}.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the tectonic history of the supercontinent Rodinia is crucial for testing proposed links among Neoproterozoic tectonics, supercontinent cycles, climate, and biogeochemistry. The Neoproterozoic Mount Harper volcanics of the Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon, Canada, interfinger with Sturtian-age (ca. 717-660 Ma) glacial deposits that were deposited in narrow, fault-bounded basins related to the breakup of Rodinia. Here, we present new paleomagnetic data from the Mount Harper volcanics and isolate four paleomagnetic directions: a low-temperature direction recording the present geomagnetic field, a mid-temperature direction consistent with a Cretaceous overprint, and two high-temperature directions, one of which is carried by hematite and likely represents a chemical overprint, and the other of which is carried by magnetite and likely is a primary direction. This primary pole passes the fold and conglomerate tests and includes a reversal but is 50{\textdegree} away from the coeval 721-712 Ma Laurentian Franklin large igneous province pole. This difference can be reconciled using a 50{\textdegree} counterclockwise rotation of the Yukon block relative to Laurentia. The prerotation reconstruction of the Yukon block relative to Laurentia aligns Neoproterozoic fault orientations and facies belts between the Wernecke and Mackenzie Mountains, rectifies paleoflow measurements in Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic strata, and realigns the orientation of the ca. 1260 Ma Bear River dikes with the Mackenzie dike swarm of northern Canada. This reconstruction also facilitates future studies that relate Neoproterozoic sedimentary and structural patterns to the fragmentation of Rodinia. Finally, this low-latitude pole supports the snowball Earth interpretation of the ca. 717 Ma Sturtian glacial deposits.},

@article{Hawkesworth2010a,
	Abstract = {The continental crust is the archive of the geological history of the Earth. Only 7% of the crust is older than 2.5 Ga, and yet significantly more crust was generated before 2.5 Ga than subsequently. Zircons offer robust records of the magmatic and crust-forming events preserved in the continental crust. They yield marked peaks of ages of crystallization and of crust formation. The latter might reflect periods of high rates of crust generation, and as such be due to magmatism associated with deep-seated mantle plumes. Alternatively the peaks are artefacts of preservation, they mark the times of supercontinent formation, and magmas generated in some tectonic settings may be preferentially preserved. There is increasing evidence that depletion of the upper mantle was in response to early planetary differentiation events. Arguments in favour of large volumes of continental crust before the end of the Archaean, and the thickness of felsic and mafic crust, therefore rely on thermal models for the progressively cooling Earth. They are consistent with recent estimates that the rates of crust generation and destruction along modern subduction zones are strikingly similar. The implication is that the present volume of continental crust was established 2-3 Ga ago.},

	Abstract = {Bends in volcanic hotspot lineaments, best represented by the large elbow in the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, were thought to directly record changes in plate motion. Several lines of geophysical inquiry now suggest that a change in the locus of upwelling in the mantle induced by mantle dynamics causes bends in hotspot tracks. Inverse modeling suggests that although deep flow near the core-mantle boundary may have played a role in the Hawaiian-Emperor bend, capture of a plume by a ridge, followed by changes in sub-Pacific mantle flow, can better explain the observations. Thus, hotspot tracks can reveal patterns of past mantle circulation.},

	Abstract = {Densities of layer 2 basalt recovered during the Deep Sea Drilling Project have been found to decrease steadily with age, a finding ascribed to progressive submarine weathering in the context of sea-floor spreading. The least-squares solution for 52 density measurements gives a rate of decrease in density of Δρ/Δt = −0.46 × 10−2 g per cm3 m.y. = −16 percent per 100 m.y., which is in excellent agreement with earlier estimates based on observed chemical depletion rates of dredged oceanic basalt. Weathering of sea-floor basalt, should it penetrate to any considerable depth in layer 2, will decrease layer 2 seismic refraction velocities, act as a source of geothermal heat, and substantially influence the chemistry of sea water and the overlying column of sediment.},

@article{Yang2008a,
	Abstract = { Abstract This study examines the dependence of surface albedo on solar zenith angle (SZA) over snow-free land surfaces using the intensive observations of surface shortwave fluxes made by the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) in 1997-2005. Results are used to evaluate the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast Systems (GFS) parameterization and several new parameterizations derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The influence of clouds on surface albedo and the albedo difference between morning and afternoon observations are also investigated. A new approach is taken to partition the observed upward flux so that the direct-beam and diffuse albedos can be separately computed. The study focused first on the ARM Southern Great Plains Central Facility site. It is found that the diffuse albedo prescribed in the NCEP GFS matched closely with the observations. The direct-beam albedo parameterized in the GFS is largely underestimated at all SZAs. The parameterizations derived from the MODIS product underestimated the direct-beam albedo at large SZAs and slightly overestimated it at small SZAs. Similar results are obtained from the analyses of observations at other stations. It is also found that the morning and afternoon dependencies of direct-beam albedo on SZA differ among the stations. Attempts are made to improve numerical model algorithms that parameterize the direct-beam albedo as a product of the direct-beam albedo at SZA = 60$\,^{\circ}$ (or the diffuse albedo), which varies with surface type or geographical location and/or season, and a function that depends only on SZA. A method is presented for computing the direct-beam albedos over these snow-free land points without referring to a particular land-cover classification scheme, which often differs from model to model. },

@article{Donohoe2011a,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe planetary albedo is partitioned into a component due to atmospheric reflection and a component due to surface reflection by using shortwave fluxes at the surface and top of the atmosphere in conjunction with a simple radiation model. The vast majority of the observed global average planetary albedo (88\%) is due to atmospheric reflection. Surface reflection makes a relatively small contribution to planetary albedo because the atmosphere attenuates the surface contribution to planetary albedo by a factor of approximately 3. The global average planetary albedo in the ensemble average of phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) preindustrial simulations is also primarily (87\%) due to atmospheric albedo. The intermodel spread in planetary albedo is relatively large and is found to be predominantly a consequence of intermodel differences in atmospheric albedo, with surface processes playing a much smaller role despite significant intermodel differences in surface albedo. The CMIP3 models show a decrease in planetary albedo under a doubling of carbon dioxide-also primarily due to changes in atmospheric reflection (which explains more than 90\% of the intermodel spread). All models show a decrease in planetary albedo due to the lowered surface albedo associated with a contraction of the cryosphere in a warmer world, but this effect is small compared to the spread in planetary albedo due to model differences in the change in clouds. },

@article{Kuznetsov2006a,
	Abstract = {New data on Sr-and C-isotopic systematics of carbonate rocks from the Upper Riphean stratotype (Karatau Group of the southern Urals) are obtained for several southwestern sections of the Bashkirian meganticlinorium, which have not been studied before. The results obtained supplement the Sr-and C-isotopic information for the group upper horizons thus detailing chemostratigraphic characterization of the entire succession. Limestone and dolostone samples used to analyze the Sr isotope composition satisfy strict geochemical criteria of the isotopic system retentivity and have been subjected to preliminary treatment in ammonium acetate to remove secondary carbonate phases. Data on 255 samples of carbonate rocks (171 studied for the first time) show that $\delta$13C value varies in the Karatau Group succession from −2.8 to +5.9 {\texttenthousand} V-PDB with several in-phase excursions from the general trend in all the sections studied in the area 90 {\texttimes} 130 km. The $\delta$13C variation trend demarcates several levels in the carbonate succession of the Karatau Group suitable for objectives of regional stratigraphy and for C-isotope chemostratigraphic subdivision of the Upper Riphean. The results of Sr isotopic analysis of 121 samples (51 unstudied before) from the Karatau Group imply that rocks in its lower part (the Katav Formation and basal horizon of the Inzer Formation) experienced considerable secondary alterations, while limestones and dolostones of the overlying interval of the group are frequently unaltered. In the ``best'' samples satisfying geochemical criteria of the isotopic system retentivity, the 87Sr/86Sr initial ratio increases from 0.70521-0.70532 in the lower Inzer deposits to 0.70611 in the upper Min'yar carbonates, decreasing to <0.70600 near the top of the latter. Above the regional hiatus separating the Min'yar and Uk formation, this ratio grows from 0.70533 to 0.70605-0.70609 in the limestone succession of the last formation.},

	Abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Tsagaan-Olom Group is exposed in the Zavkhan Terrane of southwestern Mongolia and hosts unique geochemical, paleoclimate, and paleontological records that have become central to our understanding of this pivotal interval of Earth history. New sedimentological, stratigraphic, geochronological, and geochemical data provide context for and further develop these records. Detrital zircon provenance indicates that Neoproterozoic strata of the Zavkhan Terrane were derived from basement with age peaks between 1950 to 2100 and 2400 to 2600 Ma. At ∼800 Ma, the Zavkhan Terrane transformed from an active arc and back-arc complex to a rifted ribbon continent with passive margins on both sides. Deposition was accommodated by extension, which is recorded with syn-sedimentary normal faulting and alluvial fan deposition in the Zavkhan and Khasagt formations. Passive margin sedimentation in the overlying Tsagaan-Olom Group begins with the glacigenic Maikhan-Uul Formation, which consists of two massive diamictite units separated by clast-poor graded beds of the middle member. Detrital zircon at the base of the middle member of the Maikhan-Uul Formation were dated with U-Pb chemical abrasion isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry and constrained its age to <729.8 $\pm$ 1.4 Ma. This, along with chemostratigraphy and Re/Os geochronological constraints from the overlying Taishir Formation, supports our correlation of the Maikhan-Uul Formation with the ∼717 to 660 Ma Sturtian glaciation. The Taishir Formation was deposited on a carbonate ramp in four large-scale sequence tracts that thin to the southwest. The Taishir Formation preserves a large negative δ13C excursion referred to as the Taishir excursion that covaries in carbonate and organic carbon isotopes in limestone sections. A dolomitization front at the top of the Taishir Formation also results in depleted δ13C values, however, these are related to local processes and do not represent a global Trezona excursion. Although δ13C values in the Ol Formation are highly variable along strike, 0.70756 initial strontium isotope values in limestone of the upper Ol Formation are consistent with earliest Ediacaran values. A sandstone-filled karst surface at the top of the Shuurgat Formation that overlies the Ol Formation defines the top of the Tsagaan-Olom Group and is interpreted to mark a major unconformity. Carbon and strontium isotope values in the uppermost Shuurgat Formation are also consistent with early Ediacaran values and suggest that most of the late Ediacaran Period is missing in the Zavkhan Terrane of Mongolia. Carbon isotope profiles from sections preserved as limestone and dolostone display large differences and indicate that isotopic data from dolomites should be used with caution. With our new data and correlations, we construct composite Cryogenian and Ediacaran carbon and strontium isotope curves from limestone-dominated successions in Mongolia, and then integrate additional geochronological and geochemical data sets from around the globe.},

@article{Pokrovskii2006a,
	Abstract = {Results of the study of isotopic compositions of C, O, S, and Sr in late Precambrian sections of the Patom Complex and its analogues are presented. Total scatter in $\delta$13C values is more than 21{\texttenthousand} (from −13.5 to 8.1{\texttenthousand}). The sections strongly differ in thickness, but they have similar carbon isotope curves with two dramatic drops in $\delta$13C from extremely high (>4{\texttenthousand}) to extremely low (<−8{\texttenthousand}) values. The lower negative excursion is associated with the glacial horizon (Dzhemkukan and Nichatka formations), while the upper excursion spans the entire Zhuya Group, which is as thick as 800-1000 m on the carbonate shelf (Nikol'skoe and Chencha formations along the Zhuya and Lena Rivers) and only 250-350 m at the carbonate platform (Torgo Formation, Chara River). Steady extremely high $\delta$13C values (from 7 to 8{\texttenthousand}) are typical of the glacial horizon underlying the Mariinsk Formation, as well as the Barakun and Valyukhta formations and their analogues, which separate negative excursions. The minimum 87Sr/86Sr ratios in limestones of the Kumukulakh (0.70725), Barakun (0.70727), Valyukhta (0.70769), Nikol'skoe (0.707904), Chencha (0.70786) and Torgo (0.70799) formations suggest the accumulation of sediments 660-580 Ma ago. Correspondingly, glacial diamictites of the Nichatka and Dzhemkukan (Bol'shoi Patom) formations can be correlated with the early stage of the Marinoan glaciation (635-665 Ma); the Zhuya Formation, with transgression that terminates the late stage of the same glaciation or the Gaskiers glaciation (580 Ma). Problems related to the genesis of carbonate rocks with extremely high and low $\delta$13C values will be considered in the second communication.},

	Abstract = {In SE Siberia, carbonate formations with δ13Ccarb values ranging between −12‰ and −7‰ (V-PDB) and Sr concentrations of up to 2.5% occupy an area of 40 000 km2. Several successions exceed 1000 m in thickness and represent the world's largest known exposures of sedimentary carbonates exhibiting extreme depletion in 13C. The carbonates were deposited on a carbonate platform evolving from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp to a carbonate ramp, and then from a peritidal rimmed shelf to a deep-water open shelf. All sequences reveal a facies-independent, upward rise in marine δ13Ccarb from −12‰ to −7‰. The trend and magnitude of the values mimic those that are characteristic of the 600-550 Ma Shuram-Wonoka isotope event. A coincident stratigraphic rise in 87Sr/86Sr from 0.70802 to 0.70862 in several sections of limestones, containing 4400 μg g−1 Sr on average, is considered to be by far the best available constraint on a temporal variation of seawater isotopic composition through the Late Ediacaran. If the greatest temporal rate of change in seawater 87Sr/86Sr observed in the Cenozoic is applied to the Siberian sections, the calculated minimum duration for the Suram-Wonoka event is 10 Ma.Supplementary material: XRF and ICP-AES analysis, C, O and Sr isotopic data are available at http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18324.},

	Abstract = {The Kikiktat volcanics (new name) of the northeastern Brooks Range of Arctic Alaska are exceptionally well-preserved Neoproterozoic continental tholeiites. This volcanic suite includes high-temperature picritic compositions, making them an excellent probe of mantle composition and temperature underlying the northern margin of Laurentia during the breakup of Rodinia. Detrital zircons from a volcaniclastic sample directly overlying basaltic flows of the Kikiktat volcanics were dated at 719.47 {\textpm} 0.29 Ma by U-Pb chemical abrasion{\textendash}thermal ionization mass spectrometry. This age suggests that the Kikiktat volcanics are an extension of the Franklin large igneous province. Petrogenetic modeling indicates a simple crystallization sequence of olivine {\textrightarrow} plagioclase {\textrightarrow} clinopyroxene, recording anhydrous low-pressure fractionation of a picritic parental melt. The composition of this parental liquid requires melting of harzburgite in the spinel stability field, while temperature estimates of the primary melt indicate elevated mantle potential temperatures. In contrast to the ca. 720 Ma Natkusiak basalts of Victoria Island, the Kikiktat volcanics have very low Ti concentrations, consistent with melting of harzburgitic mantle possibly by thermal conduction of an underlying plume. These data are consistent with Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic tectonic reconstructions that restore the North Slope of Arctic Alaska to the northeastern margin of Laurentia and not directly adjacent to Victoria Island.},

	Abstract = {In South China, the Wuqiangxi Formation of the Banxi Group and its equivalents underlie the early Cryogenian (Sturtian) glacial deposits but their thickness varies from <200 m to >2000 m. In the Guzhang section of western Hunan, the Wuqiangxi Formation is only 152 m thick, and an ash bed 58 m below the glacial diamictite yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb age of 809.3{\textpm}8.4 Ma. In contrast, 90 km south of the Guzhang section towards the basin in Zhijiang area where the Wuqiangxi Formation is ∼2200 m thick, an age of 725{\textpm}10 Ma has been reported from the top of this unit, 300 m below the glacial diamictite. These ages provide new evidence for the regional stratigraphic correlation across the Nanhua basin, and suggest unusually large (>2 km) stratigraphic erosion potentially associated with the Sturtian glaciation in South China. The magnitude of erosion may imply significant uplifting and tectonotopography at the onset of the Sturtian glaciation.},

	Abstract = {Here we report new SHRIMP dating results of the crystal tuff in Ejiaao Formation of middle Banxi Group in northern Guizhou. The results indicate that the volcanic deposition occurred at ∼780 Ma. We also suggests that the igneous activities across Yangtze Craton with diabase dyke swarms and basal volcanic rocks during middle Banxi time are indicative of the episodic, extensive and vigorous great bimodal igneous events during middle Neoproterozoic (825-720 Ma) in South China. The characteristics of the igneous series are contrary to the model claiming they are of island-arc origin, but suggest that they are the records of rifting process and may be related to the episodic plume activities leading to the break-up of Rodinia.},

	Abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Era was an interval characterized by profound environmental and biological transitions. Existing age models for Neoproterozoic nonglacial intervals largely have been based on correlation of carbonate carbon isotope values, but there are few tests of the assumed synchroneity of these records between basins. In contrast to the ash-poor successions typically targeted for Neoproterozoic chemostratigraphy, the Tonian to Cryogenian Tambien Group (Tigray region, Ethiopia) was deposited in an arc-proximal basin where volcanic tuffs suitable for U-Pb geochronology are preserved within the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary succession. The Tambien Group culminates in a diamictite interpreted to correlate to the ca. 717-662 Ma Sturtian snowball Earth glaciation. New physical stratigraphic data and high-precision U-Pb dates from intercalated tuffs lead to a new stratigraphic framework for the Tambien Group that confirms identification of negative δ13C values from Assem Formation limestones with the ca. 800 Ma Bitter Springs carbon isotope stage. Integration with data from the Fifteenmile Group of northwestern Canada constitutes a positive test for the global synchroneity of the Bitter Spring Stage and constrains the stage to have started after 811.51 $\pm$ 0.25 Ma and to have ended before 788.72 $\pm$ 0.24 Ma. These new temporal constraints strengthen the case for interpreting Neoproterozoic carbon isotope variation as a record of large-scale changes to the carbon cycle and provide a framework for age models of paleogeographic change, geochemical cycling, and environmental evolution during the radiation of early eukaryotes.},

	Abstract = {The Keweenawan Midcontinent Rift of North America records significant continental rifting between ca. 1110 and 1085 Ma, and preserves the most detailed paleomagnetic record of plate motion of any continent in Precambrian time. U/Pb dates from extrusive and intrusive rocks of the western Lake Superior Basin suggest a latent stage of reduced magmatic activity from ca. 1106 to 1100 Ma that places constraints on the dynamics of rift development and the record of plate motion. However, it has remained unclear whether this stage is a feature of the entire >2500-km-long rift. The succession of picritic and basaltic lava flows at Mamainse Point in the eastern Lake Superior Basin may be the most continuous and best exposed record of rift-related volcanism and magnetic reversals, but its age and duration relative to the latent stage has been uncertain due to a lack of radioisotopic dates. We present a weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 1100.36 $\pm$ 0.25 Ma on zircon crystals isolated from a newly discovered tuff within the upper reversed polarity portion of the stratigraphy below the Great Conglomerate. This date indicates that eruptive activity at Mamainse Point continued during the interval of diminished magmatic activity in the western Lake Superior Basin. This result strengthens the chronostratigraphic framework of rift development while explaining the preservation of additional geomagnetic reversals at Mamainse Point and the record of progressively decreasing paleomagnetic inclination that is indicative of rapid paleogeographic change.},

	Abstract = {Global carbon cycle perturbations throughout Earth history are frequently linked to changing paleogeography, glaciation, ocean oxygenation, and biological innovation. A pronounced carbonate carbon-isotope excursion during the Ediacaran Period (635 to 542 million years ago), accompanied by invariant or decoupled organic carbon-isotope values, has been explained with a model that relies on a large oceanic reservoir of organic carbon. We present carbonate and organic matter carbon-isotope data that demonstrate no decoupling from approximately 820 to 760 million years ago and complete decoupling between the Sturtian and Marinoan glacial events of the Cryogenian Period (approximately 720 to 635 million years ago). Growth of the organic carbon pool may be related to iron-rich and sulfate-poor deep-ocean conditions facilitated by an increase in the Fe:S ratio of the riverine flux after Sturtian glacial removal of a long-lived continental regolith.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed primary fluid inclusions in halite from marine evaporites in the ca. 830 Ma Browne Formation of the Officer Basin in Western Australia using the cryogenic scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis technique. The concentrations of the major ions, except K+ and possibly SO42−, fall within the range of Phanerozoic seawater. This is the first direct measurement of the composition of mid-Neoproterozoic seawater, and extends present-day knowledge of seawater chemistry by ∼300 m.y. Our estimates suggest that mid-Neoproterozoic marine sulfate concentrations were lower (∼90%) than modern values. By the terminal Neoproterozoic, fluid inclusions in halite and evaporite mineralogy indicate seawater sulfate levels rose significantly, to 50%-80% of modern concentrations, which parallels increases in atmospheric and oceanic oxygen.},

	Abstract = {We present a framework for interpreting the carbon isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks, which in turn requires a fundamental reinterpretation of the carbon cycle and redox budgets over Earth{\textquoteright}s history. We propose that authigenic carbonate, produced in sediment pore fluids during early diagenesis, has played a major role in the carbon cycle in the past. This sink constitutes a minor component of the carbon isotope mass balance under the modern, high levels of atmospheric oxygen but was much larger in times of low atmospheric O2 or widespread marine anoxia. Waxing and waning of a global authigenic carbonate sink helps to explain extreme carbon isotope variations in the Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Triassic.},

	Abstract = {The existence of unusually large fluctuations in the Neoproterozoic  (1,000-543 million years ago) carbon-isotopic record implies strong  perturbations to the Earth's carbon cycle. To analyze these fluctuations, we  examine records of both the isotopic content of carbonate carbon and the  fractionation between carbonate and marine organic carbon. Together, these are  inconsistent with conventional, steady-state models of the carbon cycle. The  records can be well understood, however, as deriving from the nonsteady  dynamics of two reactive pools of carbon. The lack of a steady state is traced  to an unusually large oceanic reservoir of organic carbon. We suggest that the  most significant of the Neoproterozoic negative carbon-isotopic excursions  resulted from increased remineralization of this reservoir. The terminal  event, at the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary, signals the final  diminution of the reservoir, a process that was likely initiated by  evolutionary innovations that increased export of organic matter to the deep  sea.},

@article{Rooney2014a,
	Abstract = {After nearly a billion years with no evidence for glaciation, ice advanced to equatorial latitudes at least twice between 717 and 635 Mya. Although the initiation mechanism of these Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth events has remained a mystery, the broad synchronicity of rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, the emplacement of large igneous provinces at low latitude, and the onset of the Sturtian glaciation has suggested a tectonic forcing. We present unique Re-Os geochronology and high-resolution Os and Sr isotope profiles bracketing Sturtian-age glacial deposits of the Rapitan Group in northwest Canada. Coupled with existing U-Pb dates, the postglacial Re-Os date of 662.4 $\pm$ 3.9 Mya represents direct geochronological constraints for both the onset and demise of a Cryogenian glaciation from the same continental margin and suggests a 55-My duration of the Sturtian glacial epoch. The Os and Sr isotope data allow us to assess the relative weathering input of old radiogenic crust and more juvenile, mantle-derived substrate. The preglacial isotopic signals are consistent with an enhanced contribution of juvenile material to the oceans and glacial initiation through enhanced global weatherability. In contrast, postglacial strata feature radiogenic Os and Sr isotope compositions indicative of extensive glacial scouring of the continents and intense silicate weathering in a post-Snowball Earth hothouse.},

	Abstract = {Oxygen levels in Earth{\textquoteright}s early atmosphere had an important influence on the evolution of complex life. Planavsky et al. analyzed the isotopic signature of chromium in sedimentary rocks from across the globe{\textemdash}a proxy for past oxygen levels. Oxygen levels in the mid-Proterozoic (1.6 billion to 900 million years ago) were very low: less than 0.1\% of the modern atmosphere. These low levels were probably below the minimum oxygen requirements for the earliest animals, delaying their emergence and diversification.Science, this issue p. 635The oxygenation of Earth{\textquoteright}s surface fundamentally altered global biogeochemical cycles and ultimately paved the way for the rise of metazoans at the end of the Proterozoic. However, current estimates for atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels during the billion years leading up to this time vary widely. On the basis of chromium (Cr) isotope data from a suite of Proterozoic sediments from China, Australia, and North America, interpreted in the context of data from similar depositional environments from Phanerozoic time, we find evidence for inhibited oxidation of Cr at Earth{\textquoteright}s surface in the mid-Proterozoic (1.8 to 0.8 billion years ago). These data suggest that atmospheric O2 levels were at most 0.1\% of present atmospheric levels. Direct evidence for such low O2 concentrations in the Proterozoic helps explain the late emergence and diversification of metazoans.},

@article{Mills2014a,
	Abstract = {A shift toward higher atmospheric oxygen concentration during the late Proterozoic has been inferred from multiple indirect proxies and is seen by many as a prerequisite for the emergence of complex animal life. However, the mechanisms controlling the level of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic and its eventual rise remain uncertain. Here we use a simple biogeochemical model to show that the balance between long-term carbon removal fluxes via terrestrial silicate weathering and ocean crust alteration plays a key role in determining atmospheric oxygen concentration. This balance may be shifted by changes in terrestrial weatherability or in the generation rate of oceanic crust. As a result, the terrestrial chemical weathering flux may be permanently altered-contrasting with the conventional view that the global silicate weathering flux must adjust to equal the volcanic CO2 degassing flux. Changes in chemical weathering flux in turn alter the long-term supply of phosphorus to the ocean, and therefore the flux of organic carbon burial, which is the long-term source of atmospheric oxygen. Hence we propose that increasing solar luminosity and a decrease in seafloor spreading rate over 1,500-500 Ma drove a gradual shift from seafloor weathering to terrestrial weathering, and a corresponding steady rise in atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, increased terrestrial weatherability during the late Neoproterozoic may explain low temperature, increases in ocean phosphate, ocean sulfate, and atmospheric oxygen concentration at this time.},

	Abstract = {The Tambien Group of northern Ethiopia (Tigre), with probable correlatives in Eritrea, is a 2-3-km-thick siliciclastic-carbonate succession that was deposited in an intra-oceanic arc platform setting within the southern Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) area (southern extension of the Nakfa Terrane) of the Mozambique Ocean. Its deposition occurred prior to ocean closure between converging fragments of East and West Gondwana and concomitant structural emergence of the East African Orogen (EAO). The Tambien Group is well exposed and best studied in the Mai Kenetal and Negash synclinoria, where litho- and chemostratigraphy (including δ13Ccarb, 87Sr/86Sr) provide the basis for a composite reference section. Two glaciogenic intervals have been suggested from exposures within the Didikama and Matheos Formation in the Negash Synclinorium. No reliable palaeomagnetic data exist to constrain the palaeolatitude of Tambien Group deposition and the southern ANS, but palaeogeographic reconstructions and evaporite pseudomorphs in lower carbonate units (Didikama Formation) imply low to intermediate latitudes (<45$\,^{\circ}$). Integration of available geochronological information (regional magmatism and detrital zircon) suggests c. 775-660 Ma as a plausible window constraining deposition of the prospective glacial intervals.The Tambien Group appears to preserve a coherent chemostratigraphic framework that can be effectively subdivided according to shifts in δ13Ccarb polarity [polarity intervals A (+), B (-), C (+), D (-)]. Slates underlying and interstratified with polarity interval A carbonate preserve evidence of extreme chemical weathering that lessened prior to deposition of polarity interval B carbonate. Tambien Group carbonate units have sedimentological characteristics consistent with both shallow and deeper marine depositional settings. The lower prospective glacial interval lacks diagnostic sedimentological evidence of synglacial deposition, but is overlain by negative δ13C carbonate (polarity interval B) with sedimentological characteristics consistent with well-documented cap-carbonate successions. The upper prospective glacial interval in the Negash Synclinorium (Matheos Diamictite) best exhibits characteristics consistent with glaciogenic deposition (matrix-supported polymictic clasts, possible dropstones, possible bullet-nosed and striated clasts). In contrast to pericratonic rift margin settings that are common for Cryogenian glaciogenic deposits, palaeogeographic reconstructions for the 775-660 Ma timeframe place northern Ethiopia within an intra-oceanic setting that was likely far removed from cratonic hinterlands. More work on Tambien Group sedimentology, geochronology and palaeogeography is required to better evaluate the extent and timing of glacial conditions associated with the prospective glaciogenic intervals.Supplementary material: Supplementary Table 21.1 of Tambien Group geochronological age constraints is available at http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18462.},

@article{Meybeck2003a,
	Abstract = {Continental aquatic systems from rivers to the coastal zone are considered within two perspectives: (i) as a major link between the atmosphere, pedosphere, biosphere and oceans within the Earth system with its Holocene dynamics, and (ii) as water and aquatic biota resources progressively used and transformed by humans. Human pressures have now reached a state where the continental aquatic systems can no longer be considered as being controlled by only Earth system processes, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene. Riverine changes, now observed at the global scale, are described through a first set of syndromes (flood regulation, fragmentation, sediment imbalance, neo{\textendash}arheism, salinization, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication and microbial contamination) with their related causes and symptoms. These syndromes have direct influences on water uses, either positive or negative. They also modify some Earth system key functions such as sediment, water, nutrient and carbon balances, greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic biodiversity. Evolution of river syndromes over the past 2000 years is complex: it depends upon the stages of regional human development and on natural conditions, as illustrated here for the chemical contamination syndrome. River damming, eutrophication and generalized decrease of river flow due to irrigation are some of the other global features of river changes. Future management of river systems should also consider these long{\textendash}term impacts on the Earth system.},

@article{Maloof2010a,
	Abstract = {The Cambrian diversification of animals was long thought to have begun with an explosive phase at the start of the Tommotian Age. Recent stratigraphic discoveries, however, suggest that many taxa appeared in the older Nemakit-Daldynian Age, and that the diversification was more gradual. We map lowest Cambrian (Nemakit-Daldynian through Tommotian) records of δ13CCaCO3 variability from Siberia, Mongolia, and China onto a Moroccan U/Pb-δ13CCaCO3 age model constrained by five U/Pb ages from interbedded volcanic ashes. The δ13CCaCO3 correlations ignore fossil tie points, so we assume synchroneity in δ13C trends rather than synchroneity in first appearances of animal taxa. We present new δ13Corg, 87Sr/86Sr, uranium, and vanadium data from the same carbonate samples that define the Moroccan δ13CCaCO3 curve. The result is a new absolute time line for first appearances of skeletal animals and for changes in the carbon, strontium, and redox chemistry of the ocean during the Nemakit-Daldynian and Tommotian ages at the beginning of the Cambrian. The time line suggests that the diversification of skeletal animals began early in the Nemakit-Daldynian, with much of the diversity appearing by the middle of the age. Fossil first appearances occurred in three pulses, with a small pulse in the earliest Nemakit-Daldynian (ca. 540-538 Ma), a larger pulse in the mid- to late Nemakit-Daldynian (ca. 534-530 Ma), and a moderate pulse in the Tommotian (ca. 524-522 Ma). These pulses are associated with rapid reorganizations of the carbon cycle, and are superimposed on long-term increases in sea level and the hydrothermal flux of Sr.},

@article{Macdonald2010a,
	Abstract = {The Neoproterozoic was an era of great environmental and biological change, but a paucity of direct and precise age constraints on strata from this time has prevented the complete integration of these records. We present four high-precision U-Pb ages for Neoproterozoic rocks in northwestern Canada that constrain large perturbations in the carbon cycle, a major diversification and depletion in the microfossil record, and the onset of the Sturtian glaciation. A volcanic tuff interbedded with Sturtian glacial deposits, dated at 716.5 million years ago, is synchronous with the age of the Franklin large igneous province and paleomagnetic poles that pin Laurentia to an equatorial position. Ice was therefore grounded below sea level at very low paleolatitudes, which implies that the Sturtian glaciation was global in extent.},

	Abstract = {A 2.5-dimensional climate system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 and its performance for present climate conditions are presented. The model consists of modules describing atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface processes, terrestrial vegetation cover, and global carbon cycle. The modules interact through the fluxes of momentum, energy, water and carbon. The model has a coarse spatial resolution, nevertheless capturing the major features of the Earth's geography. The model describes temporal variability of the system on seasonal and longer time scales. Due to the fact that the model does not employ flux adjustments and has a fast turnaround time, it can be used to study climates significantly different from the present one and to perform long-term (multimillennia) simulations. The comparison of the model results with present climate data show that the model successfully describes the seasonal variability of a large set of characteristics of the climate system, including radiative balance, temperature, precipitation, ocean circulation and cryosphere.},

@article{Zhuo2013a,
	Abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Kangdian Rift Basin is a continental rift basin in the western Yangtze Continent. Determining its time of opening and subsequent filling pattern is an important aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of the Yangtze Continent, South China. The Luliang Formation is the early filling in the eastern part of this rift basin, and its deposition age and filling sequence are significant for studies of the regional stratigraphic correlation, opening time, and filling pattern of this basin. Having been correlated to the upper part of the Mesoproterozoic Kunyang Group or to the Neoproterozoic Chengjiang Formation, the age and regional stratigraphic correlation of the Luliang Formation have long been uncertain. This is due to a lack of reliable absolute age constraints. To address this issue, the first zircon SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology has been established for this formation, yielding two high-precision isotopic ages of 818.6{\textpm}9.2 and 805{\textpm}14 Ma for the tuff layers at the bottoms of the lower and upper members of the Luliang Formation, respectively. Given the error factor, the bottom age of the lower member of the Luliang Formation can be interpreted as ca. 820 Ma, corresponding to the bottom age of the lower part of the Banxi Group, which is the early filling of the Neoproterozoic Xianggui Rift Basin, a representative basin of the Neoproterozoic rift basins in the Yangtze Continent, South China. The bottom age of the upper member of the Luliang Formation can be interpreted as ca. 800{\textpm}5 Ma, corresponding to the bottom age of the Chengjiang Formation in the western part of the Neoproterozoic Kangdian Rift Basin and also corresponding to the bottom age of the upper part of the Banxi Group in the Neoproterozoic Xianggui Rift Basin. These ages indicate that the Neoproterozoic Kangdian Rift Basin shares the same opening time and filling sequences as those of the other Neoproterozoic rift basins in South China. Basin analysis shows that the Neoproterozoic Kangdian Rift Basin is a typical half-graben basin, with its main boundary fault in the west and basin center in the east. This basin consisted of mini unidirectional half-graben basins in its juvenile stage and simplified to become a large united half-graben basin in its mature stage, i.e., a supradetachment basin.},

	Abstract = {In the newly revised Regional Chronostratigraphic (Geochronologic) Scale of China, the original bipartite division of the Neoproterozoic is changed to tripartite division. The three ``system''-rank chronostratigraphic units are in ascending order of the Qingbaikou, Nanhua and Sinian Systems. This report presents SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating on volcanic tuffs from the candidate stratotype section of the Nanhua System at the Yangjiaping section that is geographically located in Hupingshan Town, Shimen County, Hunan Province. Tuff from the upper part of the Xieshuihe Formation (equivalent to the Liantuo Formation) in the Lower Nanhua Series yields a zircon U-Pb age of 758 {\textpm} 23 Ma, which may provide a constraint on the lower limit of the Gucheng glacial stage in the Nanhua System. Tuff from the Laoshanya Formation of its underlying Qingbaikou System (equivalent to the Banxi Group) gives a zircon U-Pb age of 809 {\textpm} 16 Ma. The sampling locality lies 12 m from the upper boundary of the Qingbaikou System. According to the sedimentation rate it is estimated that the upper boundary age is about 800 Ma. The present studies also provide a resolution to the long-standing problems concerning stratigraphic correlation of the Late Precambrian in South China whether the Liantuo Formation is equivalent to the Banxi Group or not.},

@article{Wang2015a,
	Abstract = {Recent results of research from a regional geological survey have demonstrated that the Neoproterozoic Nanhuan strata in the Jiangnan sub-basin in the Nanhua rift in South China are built up of ``wedge-shaped strata'', which rest transgressively on the metamorphic basement. These strata are grouped, as indicated by our sedimentary facies analysis, into the following four depositional successions (with ten related sedimentary facies associations): (1) continental volcanic depositional succession; (2) continental siliciclastic depositional succession; (3) marine siliciclastic depositional succession; and (4) glacial depositional succession. Compared with the Hunan-Guangxi sub-basin and the Northern Zhejiang sub-basin, the sedimentary processes in the Jiangnan sub-basin are dominated by continental rather than marine facies. However, similar sedimentary successions with identical facies trends can be recognized in all these sub-basins. All the Neoproterozoic basin fills in South China are characterized by a deepening water trend leading from continental to fully marine facies, recording the evolution of a typical rift basin related to the break-up of Rodinia. The crystalline zircons from a rhyolite sample taken from the base part of the first succession in the Jiangnan sub-basin give a mean SHRIMP U-Pb age of 803 {\textpm} 9 Ma. The occurrence of the ca. 803 Ma volcanic rocks and the volcaniclastic rocks marks the onset of a new phase of depositional cycles in the Jiangnan sub-basin.},

@article{Gernon2016a,
	Abstract = {During Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations, the oceans gained massive amounts of alkalinity, culminating in the deposition of massive cap carbonates on deglaciation. Changes in terrestrial runoff associated with both breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent and deglaciation can explain some, but not all of the requisite changes in ocean chemistry. Submarine volcanism along shallow ridges formed during supercontinent breakup results in the formation of large volumes of glassy hyaloclastite, which readily alters to palagonite. Here we estimate fluxes of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, silica and bicarbonate associated with these shallow-ridge processes, and argue that extensive submarine volcanism during the breakup of Rodinia made an important contribution to changes in ocean chemistry during Snowball Earth glaciations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that widespread hyaloclastite alteration under near-global sea-ice cover could lead to Ca2+ and Mg2+ supersaturation over the course of the glaciation that is sufficient to explain the volume of cap carbonates deposited. Furthermore, our conservative estimates of phosphorus release are sufficient to explain the observed P:Fe ratios in sedimentary iron formations from this time. This large phosphorus release may have fuelled primary productivity, which in turn would have contributed to atmospheric O2 rises that followed Snowball Earth episodes.},

@article{Donnadieu2004a,
	Abstract = {In order to simulate the climatic conditions of the Neoproterozoic, we have conducted a series of simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2, using a reduced solar constant of 6\% and varied CO2 concentrations. We have also tested the impact of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia that has been hypothesized to play an important role in the initiation of an ice-covered Earth. Our results show that for the critical values of 89 and 149 ppm of atmospheric CO2, a snowball Earth occurs in the supercontinent case and in the dislocated configuration, respectively. The study of the sensitivity of the meridional oceanic energy transport to reductions in CO2 concentration and to the dislocation of the supercontinent demonstrates that dynamics ocean processes can modulate the CO2 threshold value, below which a snowball solution is found, but cannot prevent it. The collapse of the overturning cells and of the oceanic heat transport is mainly due to the reduced zonal temperature gradient once the sea-ice line reaches the 30{\textdegree} latitudinal band but also to the freshening of the tropical ocean by sea-ice melt. In term of feedbacks, the meridional atmospheric heat transport via the Hadley circulation plays the major role, all along the CO2 decrease, by increasing the energy brought in the front of the sea-ice margin but does not appear enough efficient to prevent the onset of the sea-ice-albedo instability in the case of the continental configurations tested in this contribution.},

	Abstract = {Earth{\textquoteright}s surface chemical environment has evolved from an early anoxic condition to the oxic state we have today. Transitional between an earlier Proterozoic world with widespread deep-water anoxia and a Phanerozoic world with large oxygen-utilizing animals, the Neoproterozoic Era [1000 to 542 million years ago (Ma)] plays a key role in this history. The details of Neoproterozoic Earth surface oxygenation, however, remain unclear. We report that through much of the later Neoproterozoic (\&lt;742 {\textpm} 6 Ma), anoxia remained widespread beneath the mixed layer of the oceans; deeper water masses were sometimes sulfidic but were mainly Fe2+-enriched. These ferruginous conditions marked a return to ocean chemistry not seen for more than one billion years of Earth history.},

	Abstract = {The Dajiangbian Formation in South China is a siliciclastic-dominated sedimentary succession with low-grade metamorphism deposited on the western margin of the Cathaysia Block, and is capped by a glaciogenic diamictite (the Sizhoushan Formation). The Sizhoushan glaciogenic strata can be attributed to the Jiangkou glacial (Sturtian glacial) episode as they share stratigraphic and lithological similarities with Jiangkou strata in South China. Some carbonate, chert and shale units throughout the upper part of the Dajiangbian Formation were sampled for carbonate carbon isotope ($\delta$13Ccarb) and organic carbon isotope ($\delta$13Corg) analyses. A range of geochemical indices including oxygen isotopes ($\delta$18O) and Mn/Sr (Fe/Sr) ratios suggest that primary carbon isotope values were preserved in the upper Dajiangbian Formation. The upper Dajiangbian Formation shows $\delta$13Ccarb of -0.1{\texttenthousand}, upward decreasing towards to -5.4{\texttenthousand}. We suggest that the negative $\delta$13C excursion beneath the Sizhoushan diamictite is correlative with the Pre-Sturtian Islay $\delta$13Ccarb anomaly and allows correlation with the global Neoproterozoic isotope stratigraphy. We find that carbonate and organic carbon isotope data of the upper Dajiangbian Formation are coupled, consistent with the $\delta$13Ccarb-$\delta$13Corg pattern observed on multiple continents.},
